    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1 PigmentationTravoprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid), and eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as travoprost is administered. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of travoprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. The long-term effects of increased pigmentation are not known.Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While treatment with travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution) can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly[seePatient Counseling Information (17)].5.2 Eyelash ChangesTravoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution) may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye. These changes include increased length, thickness, and number of lashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment[seePatient Counseling Information (17)].5.3 Intraocular InflammationTravoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution) should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., uveitis) because the inflammation may be exacerbated.5.4 Macular EdemaMacular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with travoprost ophthalmic solution. Travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution) should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.5.5 Angle-closure, Inflammatory or Neovascular GlaucomaTravoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution)has not been evaluated for the treatment of angle-closure, inflammatory or neovascular glaucoma.5.6 Bacterial KeratitisThere have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface[seePatient Counseling Information (17)].5.7 Use with Contact LensesContact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution) and may be reinserted 15 minutes following its administration.\n5.1 PigmentationTravoprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk.In animal reproduction studies, subcutaneous (SC) administration of travoprost to pregnant mice and rats throughout the period of organogenesis produced embryo-fetal lethality, spontaneous abortion, and premature delivery at potentially clinically relevant doses.Advise pregnant women of a potential risk to a fetus. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution) should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.DataAnimal DataAn embryo-fetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered travoprost once daily by SC injection from gestation day (GD) 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. At 10 mcg/kg (60 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose [MRHOD], based on estimated plasma Cmax), travoprost was teratogenic in rats, evidenced by an increase in the incidence of skeletal malformations as well as external and visceral malformations, including fused sternebrae, domed head and hydrocephaly. Travoprost caused post-implantation loss at 10 mcg/kg. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for post-implantation loss was 3 mcg/kg (18 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax). The maternal NOAEL was 10 mcg/kg.An embryo-fetal study was conducted in pregnant mice administered travoprost once daily by SC injection from GD 6 to 11, to target the period of organogenesis. At 1 mcg/kg (6 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax), travoprost caused postimplantation loss and decreased fetal weight. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for malformations was 0.3 mcg/kg (2 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax). The maternal NOAEL was 1 mcg/kg.Pre/postnatal studies were conducted in rats administered travoprost once daily by subcutaneous injection from GD 7 (early embryonic period) to postnatal Day 21 (end of lactation period). At doses of greater than or equal to 0.12 mcg/kg/day (0.7 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax), adverse pregnancy outcomes (embryo-fetal lethality, abortion, and early delivery), low-birth weight and developmental delays were observed. The NOAEL for adverse pregnancy outcomes, low-birth weight and developmental delay was 0.1 mcg/kg (0.6 times the MHROD, based on estimated plasma Cmax). The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 0.72 mcg/kg (4 times the MHROD, based on estimated plasma Cmax).8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the effects of travoprost on the breastfed child or milk production. It is not known if travoprost is present in human milk following ophthalmic administration. A study in lactating rats demonstrated that radio-labeled travoprost and/or its metabolites were excreted in milk following subcutaneous administration.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution) and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution).8.4 Pediatric UseUse in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years is not recommended because of potential safety concerns related to increased pigmentation following long-term chronic use.8.5 Geriatric UseNo overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients.8.6 Hepatic and Renal ImpairmentTravoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% has been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and also in patients with renal impairment.

Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution) should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.DataAnimal DataAn embryo-fetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered travoprost once daily by SC injection from gestation day (GD) 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. At 10 mcg/kg (60 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose [MRHOD], based on estimated plasma Cmax), travoprost was teratogenic in rats, evidenced by an increase in the incidence of skeletal malformations as well as external and visceral malformations, including fused sternebrae, domed head and hydrocephaly. Travoprost caused post-implantation loss at 10 mcg/kg. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for post-implantation loss was 3 mcg/kg (18 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax). The maternal NOAEL was 10 mcg/kg.An embryo-fetal study was conducted in pregnant mice administered travoprost once daily by SC injection from GD 6 to 11, to target the period of organogenesis. At 1 mcg/kg (6 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax), travoprost caused postimplantation loss and decreased fetal weight. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for malformations was 0.3 mcg/kg (2 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax). The maternal NOAEL was 1 mcg/kg.Pre/postnatal studies were conducted in rats administered travoprost once daily by subcutaneous injection from GD 7 (early embryonic period) to postnatal Day 21 (end of lactation period). At doses of greater than or equal to 0.12 mcg/kg/day (0.7 times the MRHOD, based on estimated plasma Cmax), adverse pregnancy outcomes (embryo-fetal lethality, abortion, and early delivery), low-birth weight and developmental delays were observed. The NOAEL for adverse pregnancy outcomes, low-birth weight and developmental delay was 0.1 mcg/kg (0.6 times the MHROD, based on estimated plasma Cmax). The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 0.72 mcg/kg (4 times the MHROD, based on estimated plasma Cmax).8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the effects of travoprost on the breastfed child or milk production. It is not known if travoprost is present in human milk following ophthalmic administration. A study in lactating rats demonstrated that radio-labeled travoprost and/or its metabolites were excreted in milk following subcutaneous administration.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution) and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% (ionic buffered solution).8.4 Pediatric UseUse in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years is not recommended because of potential safety concerns related to increased pigmentation following long-term chronic use.8.5 Geriatric UseNo overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients.8.6 Hepatic and Renal ImpairmentTravoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% has been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and also in patients with renal impairment.

    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "12.1 Mechanism of ActionTravoprost free acid, a prostaglandin analog is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist which is believed to reduce IOP by increasing uveoscleral outflow. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time.12.3 PharmacokineticsTravoprost is absorbed through the cornea and is hydrolyzed to the active free acid. Data from 4 multiple dose pharmacokinetic studies (totaling 107 subjects) have shown that plasma concentrations of the free acid are below 0.01 ng/mL (the quantitation limit of the assay) in two-thirds of the subjects. In those individuals with quantifiable plasma concentrations (N = 38), the mean plasma Cmaxwas 0.018 \u00b1 0.007 ng/mL (ranged 0.01 to 0.052 ng/mL) and was reached within 30 minutes. From these studies, travoprost is estimated to have a plasma half-life of 45 minutes. There was no difference in plasma concentrations between Days 1 and 7, indicating steady-state was reached early and that there was no significant accumulation.Travoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to its biologically active free acid. Systemically, travoprost free acid is metabolized to inactive metabolites via beta-oxidation of the \u03b1 (carboxylic acid) chain to give the 1,2-dinor and 1,2,3,4-tetranor analogs, via oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl moiety, as well as via reduction of the 13, 14 double bond.The elimination of travoprost free acid from plasma was rapid and levels were generally below the limit of quantification within one hour after dosing. The terminal elimination half-life of travoprost free acid was estimated from fourteen subjects and ranged from 17 minutes to 86 minutes with the mean half-life of 45 minutes. Less than 2% of the topical ocular dose of travoprost was excreted in the urine within 4 hours as the travoprost free acid.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionTravoprost free acid, a prostaglandin analog is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist which is believed to reduce IOP by increasing uveoscleral outflow.

Systemically, travoprost free acid is metabolized to inactive metabolites via beta-oxidation of the \u03b1 (carboxylic acid) chain to give the 1,2-dinor and 1,2,3,4-tetranor analogs, via oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl moiety, as well as via reduction of the 13, 14 double bond.The elimination of travoprost free acid from plasma was rapid and levels were generally below the limit of quantification within one hour after dosing. The terminal elimination half-life of travoprost free acid was estimated from fourteen subjects and ranged from 17 minutes to 86 minutes with the mean half-life of 45 minutes. Less than 2% of the topical ocular dose of travoprost was excreted in the urine within 4 hours as the travoprost free acid.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionTravoprost free acid, a prostaglandin analog is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist which is believed to reduce IOP by increasing uveoscleral outflow. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time.12.3 PharmacokineticsTravoprost is absorbed through the cornea and is hydrolyzed to the active free acid. Data from 4 multiple dose pharmacokinetic studies (totaling 107 subjects) have shown that plasma concentrations of the free acid are below 0.01 ng/mL (the quantitation limit of the assay) in two-thirds of the subjects. In those individuals with quantifiable plasma concentrations (N = 38), the mean plasma Cmaxwas 0.018 \u00b1 0.007 ng/mL (ranged 0.01 to 0.052 ng/mL) and was reached within 30 minutes.
