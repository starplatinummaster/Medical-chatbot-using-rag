    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1 Delayed HealingTopical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems.5.2 Cross-Sensitivity or HypersensitivityThere is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other NSAIDs. There have been reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution in patients who have either a known hypersensitivity to aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or a past medical history of asthma. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs.5.3 Increased Bleeding TimeWith some NSAIDs, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery.It is recommended that ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution 0.5% be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications, which may prolong bleeding time.5.4 Corneal EffectsUse of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs and should be closely monitored for corneal health.Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients.Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 1 day prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days post-surgery may increase patient risk for the occurrence and severity of corneal adverse events.5.5 Contact Lens WearKetorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution 0.5%should not be administered while wearing contact lenses.\n5.1 Delayed HealingTopical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may slow or delay healing.

Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems.5.2 Cross-Sensitivity or HypersensitivityThere is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other NSAIDs. There have been reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution in patients who have either a known hypersensitivity to aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or a past medical history of asthma. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs.5.3 Increased Bleeding TimeWith some NSAIDs, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery.It is recommended that ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution 0.5% be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications, which may prolong bleeding time.5.4 Corneal EffectsUse of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs and should be closely monitored for corneal health.Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients.Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 1 day prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days post-surgery may increase patient risk for the occurrence and severity of corneal adverse events.5.5 Contact Lens WearKetorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution 0.5%should not be administered while wearing contact lenses.\n5.1 Delayed HealingTopical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may slow or delay healing.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyTeratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category CPregnancy Category C: Ketorolac tromethamine, administered during organogenesis, was not teratogenic in rabbits and rats at oral doses of 3.6 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are approximately 100 times and 250 times higher respectively than the maximum recommended human topical ophthalmic daily dose of 2 mg (5 mg/mL x 0.05 mL/drop, x4 drops x 2 eyes) to affected eyes on a mg/kg basis. Additionally, when administered to rats after Day 17 of gestation at oral doses up to 1.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 40 times the typical human topical ophthalmic daily dose), ketorolac tromethamine resulted in dystocia and increased pup mortality. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution 0.5% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Nonteratogenic Effects:Because of the known effects of prostaglandin-inhibiting drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution 0.5%during late pregnancy should be avoided.8.3 Nursing MothersBecause many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution 0.5% is administered to a nursing woman.8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age of 2 have not been established.8.5 Geriatric UseNo overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients.\n8.1 PregnancyTeratogenic Effects.

    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "12.1 Mechanism of ActionKetorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug which, when administered systemically, has demonstrated analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic activity. The mechanism of its action is thought to be due to its ability to inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis.12.3 PharmacokineticsTwo drops of 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution instilled into the eyes of patients 12 hours and 1 hour prior to cataract extraction achieved a mean ketorolac concentration of 95 ng/mL in the aqueous humor of 8 of 9 eyes tested (range 40 to 170 ng/mL).One drop of 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution was instilled into 1 eye and 1 drop of vehicle into the other eye TID in 26 healthy subjects. Five (5) of 26 subjects had detectable concentrations of ketorolac in their plasma (range 11 to 23 ng/mL) at Day 10 during topical ocular treatment.
