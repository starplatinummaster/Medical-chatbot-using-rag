    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION": "The recommended dose is one drop of tafluprost ophthalmic solution in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.The dose should not exceed once daily since it has been shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may lessen the intraocular pressure lowering effect.Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 2 to 4 hours after the first administration with the maximum effect reached after 12 hours.Tafluprost ophthalmic solution may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower intraocular pressure. If more than one topical ophthalmic product is being used, each one should be administered at least 5 minutes apart.The solution from one individual unit is to be used immediately after opening for administration to one or both eyes. Since sterility cannot be maintained after the individual unit is opened, the remaining contents should be discarded immediately after administration.\nThe recommended dose is one drop of tafluprost ophthalmic solution in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.The dose should not exceed once daily since it has been shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may lessen the intraocular pressure lowering effect.Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 2 to 4 hours after the first administration with the maximum effect reached after 12 hours.Tafluprost ophthalmic solution may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower intraocular pressure.

    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1 PigmentationTafluprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid) and eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as tafluprost is administered. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of tafluprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. The long term effects of increased pigmentation are not known.Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While treatment with tafluprost ophthalmic solution can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly.[See Patient Counseling Information (17.3)].5.2 Eyelash ChangesTafluprost may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye. These changes include increased length, color, thickness, shape and number of lashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.5.3 Intraocular InflammationTafluprost should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., iritis/uveitis) because the inflammation may be exacerbated.5.4 Macular EdemaMacular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with prostaglandin F2\u03b1 analogs. Tafluprost should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.\n5.1 PigmentationTafluprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyPregnancy Category C.Teratogenic effects: In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, tafluprost administered intravenously was teratogenic. Tafluprost caused increases in post-implantation losses in rats and rabbits and reductions in fetal body weights in rats. Tafluprost also increased the incidence of vertebral skeletal abnormalities in rats and the incidence of skull, brain and spine malformations in rabbits. In rats, there were no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development at a dose of 3 mcg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma levels of tafluprost acid that were 343 times the maximum clinical exposure based on Cmax. In rabbits, effects were seen at a tafluprost dose of 0.03 mcg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma levels of tafluprost acid during organogenesis that were approximately 5 times higher than the clinical exposure based on Cmax. At the no-effect dose in rabbits (0.01 mcg/kg/day), maternal plasma levels of tafluprost acid were below the lower level of quantification (20 pg/mL).In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, increased mortality of newborns, decreased body weights and delayed pinna unfolding were observed in offsprings. The no observed adverse effect level was at a tafluprost intravenous dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/day which is greater than 3 times the maximum recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison.There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant woman. Although animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, tafluprost should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Women of childbearing age/potential should have adequate contraceptive measures in place.8.3 Nursing MothersA study in lactating rats demonstrated that radio-labeled tafluprost and/or its metabolites were excreted in milk. It is not known whether this drug or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tafluprost is administered to a nursing woman.8.4 Pediatric UseUse in pediatric patients is not recommended because of potential safety concerns related to increased pigmentation following long-term chronic use.8.5 Geriatric UseNo overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients.\n8.1 PregnancyPregnancy Category C.Teratogenic effects: In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, tafluprost administered intravenously was teratogenic.

Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tafluprost is administered to a nursing woman.8.4 Pediatric UseUse in pediatric patients is not recommended because of potential safety concerns related to increased pigmentation following long-term chronic use.8.5 Geriatric UseNo overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients.\n8.1 PregnancyPregnancy Category C.Teratogenic effects: In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, tafluprost administered intravenously was teratogenic. Tafluprost caused increases in post-implantation losses in rats and rabbits and reductions in fetal body weights in rats. Tafluprost also increased the incidence of vertebral skeletal abnormalities in rats and the incidence of skull, brain and spine malformations in rabbits. In rats, there were no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development at a dose of 3 mcg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma levels of tafluprost acid that were 343 times the maximum clinical exposure based on Cmax. In rabbits, effects were seen at a tafluprost dose of 0.03 mcg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma levels of tafluprost acid during organogenesis that were approximately 5 times higher than the clinical exposure based on Cmax. At the no-effect dose in rabbits (0.01 mcg/kg/day), maternal plasma levels of tafluprost acid were below the lower level of quantification (20 pg/mL).In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, increased mortality of newborns, decreased body weights and delayed pinna unfolding were observed in offsprings. The no observed adverse effect level was at a tafluprost intravenous dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/day which is greater than 3 times the maximum recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison.There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant woman.

The acid metabolite is further metabolized via fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and phase II conjugation.EliminationMean plasma tafluprost acid concentrations were below the limit of quantification of the bioanalytical assay (10 pg/mL) at 30 minutes following topical ocular administration of tafluprost 0.0015% ophthalmic solution.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionTafluprost acid, a prostaglandin analog is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist which is believed to reduce intraocular pressure by increasing uveoscleral outflow. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time.12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorptionFollowing instillation, tafluprost is absorbed through the cornea and is hydrolyzed to the biologically active acid metabolite, tafluprost acid. Following instillation of one drop of the 0.0015% solution once daily into each eye of healthy volunteers, the plasma concentrations of tafluprost acid peaked at a median time of 10 minutes on both Days 1 and 8. The mean plasma Cmaxof tafluprost acid were 26 pg/mL and 27 pg/mL on Day 1, and Day 8, respectively. The mean plasma AUC estimates of tafluprost acid were 394 pg*min/mL and 432 pg*min/mL on Day 1 and 8, respectively.MetabolismTafluprost, an ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed to its biologically active acid metabolite in the eye.

    "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION": "See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (Patient Information).17.1 Nightly ApplicationAdvise patients to not exceed once daily dosing since more frequent administration may decrease the intraocular pressure lowering effect of tafluprost.17.2 Handling the Single-Dose ContainerAdvise patients that tafluprost ophthalmic solution is a sterile solution that does not contain a preservative. The solution from one individual unit is to be used immediately after opening for administration to one or both eyes. Since sterility cannot be maintained after the individual unit is opened, the remaining contents should be discarded immediately after administration.17.3 Potential for PigmentationAdvise patients about the potential for increased brown pigmentation of the iris, which may be permanent. Also inform patients about the possibility of eyelid skin darkening, which may be reversible after discontinuation of tafluprost ophthalmic solution.17.4 Potential for Eyelash ChangesInform patients of the possibility of eyelash and vellus hair changes in the treated eye during treatment with tafluprost ophthalmic solution. These changes may result in a disparity between eyes in length, thickness, pigmentation, number of eyelashes or vellus hairs, and/or direction of eyelash growth. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.17.5 When to Seek Physician AdviceAdvise patients that if they develop a new ocular condition (e.g., trauma or infection), experience a sudden decrease in visual acuity, have ocular surgery, or develop any ocular reactions, particularly conjunctivitis and eyelid reactions, they should immediately seek their physician\u2019s advice concerning the continued use of tafluprost ophthalmic solution.17.6 Use with Other Ophthalmic DrugsIf more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes between applications.17.7 Storage InformationInstruct patients on proper storage of cartons, unopened foil pouches, and opened foil pouches[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].Recommended storage for cartons and unopened foil pouches is to store refrigerated at 2\u00ba to 8\u00b0C (36\u00ba to 46\u00b0F).
