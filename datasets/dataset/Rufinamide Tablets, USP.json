    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1\tSuicidal Behavior and IdeationAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including rufinamide tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono-and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.Table 1: Absolute and Relative Risk of Suicidal Behavior and IdeationIndicationPlacebo Patients with Events Per 1000 PatientsDrug Patients with Events Per 1000 PatientsRelative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo PatientsRisk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000PatientsEpilepsy13.43.52.4Psychiatric5.78.51.52.9Other11.81.90.9Total2.44.31.81.9The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.Anyone considering prescribing rufinamide tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.5.2\tCentral Nervous System ReactionsUse of rufinamide tablets has been associated with central nervous system-related adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial of patients 4 years or older with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The most significant of these can be classified into two general categories: 1) somnolence or fatigue, and 2) coordination abnormalities, dizziness, gait disturbances, and ataxia.Somnolence was reported in 24% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 13% of patients on placebo, and led to study discontinuation in 3% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 0% of patients on placebo. Fatigue was reported in 10% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 8% of patients on placebo patients. It led to study discontinuation in 1% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients and 0% of patients on placebo patients.Dizziness was reported in 2.7% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 0% of patients on placebo, and did not lead to study discontinuation.Ataxia and gait disturbance were reported in 5.4% and 1.4% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients, respectively, compared to no patient on placebo. None of these reactions led to study discontinuation.Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on rufinamide tablet to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.5.3\tQT ShorteningFormal cardiac ECG studies demonstrated shortening of the QT interval (mean=20 msec, for doses >2400 mg twice daily) with rufinamide tablets. In a placebo-controlled study of the QT interval, a higher percentage of rufinamide tablet-treated subjects (46% at 2400 mg, 46% at 3200 mg, and 65% at 4800 mg) had a QT shortening of greater than 20 msec\u00a0 at Tmaxcompared to placebo (5 to 10%).Reductions of the QT interval below 300 msec were not observed in the formal QT studies with doses up to 7200 mg per day. Moreover, there was no signal for drug-induced sudden death or ventricular arrhythmias.The degree of QT shortening induced by rufinamide tablets is without any known clinical risk. Familial Short QT syndrome is associated with an increased risk of sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation. Such events in this syndrome are believed to occur primarily when the corrected QT interval falls below 300 msec. Non-clinical data also indicate that QT shortening is associated with ventricular fibrillation.Patients with Familial Short QT syndrome should not be treated with rufinamide tablets. Caution should be used when administering rufinamide tablet with other drugs that shorten the QT interval[seeContraindications (4)].5.4\tMulti-organ Hypersensitivity/Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic     Symptoms (DRESS)Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including rufinamide tablets. DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.All cases of DRESS identified in clinical trials with rufinamide tablets occurred in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, and resolved or improved with rufinamide tablet discontinuation. DRESS has also been reported in adult and pediatric patients taking rufinamide tablets in the postmarketing setting.If DRESS is suspected, the patient should be evaluated immediately, rufinamide tablets should be discontinued, and alternative treatment should be started.5.5\tWithdrawal of AEDsAs with all antiepileptic drugs, rufinamide tablets should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of precipitating seizures, seizure exacerbation, or status epilepticus. If abrupt discontinuation of the drug is medically necessary, the transition to another AED should be made under close medical supervision. In clinical trials, rufinamide tablets discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every 2 days.5.6\tStatus EpilepticusEstimates of the incidence of treatment emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with rufinamide tablets are difficult because standard definitions were not employed. In a controlled Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome trial, 3 of 74 (4.1%) rufinamide tablet-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus in the rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared with none of the 64 patients in the placebo-treated patients. In all controlled trials that included patients with different epilepsies, 11 of 1240 (0.9%) rufinamide tablet-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus compared with none of 635 patients in the placebo-treated patients.5.7\tLeukopeniaRufinamide tablet has been shown to reduce white cell count. Leukopenia (white cell count < 3X109L) was more commonly observed in rufinamide tablet-treated patients 43 of 1171 (3.7%) than placebo-treated patients, 7 of 579 (1.2%) in all controlled trials.\n5.1\tSuicidal Behavior and IdeationAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including rufinamide tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication.

Caution should be used when administering rufinamide tablet with other drugs that shorten the QT interval[seeContraindications (4)].5.4\tMulti-organ Hypersensitivity/Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic     Symptoms (DRESS)Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including rufinamide tablets. DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.All cases of DRESS identified in clinical trials with rufinamide tablets occurred in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, and resolved or improved with rufinamide tablet discontinuation. DRESS has also been reported in adult and pediatric patients taking rufinamide tablets in the postmarketing setting.If DRESS is suspected, the patient should be evaluated immediately, rufinamide tablets should be discontinued, and alternative treatment should be started.5.5\tWithdrawal of AEDsAs with all antiepileptic drugs, rufinamide tablets should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of precipitating seizures, seizure exacerbation, or status epilepticus. If abrupt discontinuation of the drug is medically necessary, the transition to another AED should be made under close medical supervision. In clinical trials, rufinamide tablets discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every 2 days.5.6\tStatus EpilepticusEstimates of the incidence of treatment emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with rufinamide tablets are difficult because standard definitions were not employed. In a controlled Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome trial, 3 of 74 (4.1%) rufinamide tablet-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus in the rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared with none of the 64 patients in the placebo-treated patients. In all controlled trials that included patients with different epilepsies, 11 of 1240 (0.9%) rufinamide tablet-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus compared with none of 635 patients in the placebo-treated patients.5.7\tLeukopeniaRufinamide tablet has been shown to reduce white cell count. Leukopenia (white cell count < 3X109L) was more commonly observed in rufinamide tablet-treated patients 43 of 1171 (3.7%) than placebo-treated patients, 7 of 579 (1.2%) in all controlled trials.\n5.1\tSuicidal Behavior and IdeationAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including rufinamide tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono-and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.Table 1: Absolute and Relative Risk of Suicidal Behavior and IdeationIndicationPlacebo Patients with Events Per 1000 PatientsDrug Patients with Events Per 1000 PatientsRelative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo PatientsRisk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000PatientsEpilepsy13.43.52.4Psychiatric5.78.51.52.9Other11.81.90.9Total2.44.31.81.9The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.Anyone considering prescribing rufinamide tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.5.2\tCentral Nervous System ReactionsUse of rufinamide tablets has been associated with central nervous system-related adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial of patients 4 years or older with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The most significant of these can be classified into two general categories: 1) somnolence or fatigue, and 2) coordination abnormalities, dizziness, gait disturbances, and ataxia.Somnolence was reported in 24% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 13% of patients on placebo, and led to study discontinuation in 3% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 0% of patients on placebo. Fatigue was reported in 10% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 8% of patients on placebo patients. It led to study discontinuation in 1% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients and 0% of patients on placebo patients.Dizziness was reported in 2.7% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 0% of patients on placebo, and did not lead to study discontinuation.Ataxia and gait disturbance were reported in 5.4% and 1.4% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients, respectively, compared to no patient on placebo. None of these reactions led to study discontinuation.Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on rufinamide tablet to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.5.3\tQT ShorteningFormal cardiac ECG studies demonstrated shortening of the QT interval (mean=20 msec, for doses >2400 mg twice daily) with rufinamide tablets. In a placebo-controlled study of the QT interval, a higher percentage of rufinamide tablet-treated subjects (46% at 2400 mg, 46% at 3200 mg, and 65% at 4800 mg) had a QT shortening of greater than 20 msec\u00a0 at Tmaxcompared to placebo (5 to 10%).Reductions of the QT interval below 300 msec were not observed in the formal QT studies with doses up to 7200 mg per day. Moreover, there was no signal for drug-induced sudden death or ventricular arrhythmias.The degree of QT shortening induced by rufinamide tablets is without any known clinical risk. Familial Short QT syndrome is associated with an increased risk of sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation. Such events in this syndrome are believed to occur primarily when the corrected QT interval falls below 300 msec. Non-clinical data also indicate that QT shortening is associated with ventricular fibrillation.Patients with Familial Short QT syndrome should not be treated with rufinamide tablets.

Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.All cases of DRESS identified in clinical trials with rufinamide tablets occurred in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, and resolved or improved with rufinamide tablet discontinuation. DRESS has also been reported in adult and pediatric patients taking rufinamide tablets in the postmarketing setting.If DRESS is suspected, the patient should be evaluated immediately, rufinamide tablets should be discontinued, and alternative treatment should be started.5.5\tWithdrawal of AEDsAs with all antiepileptic drugs, rufinamide tablets should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of precipitating seizures, seizure exacerbation, or status epilepticus. If abrupt discontinuation of the drug is medically necessary, the transition to another AED should be made under close medical supervision. In clinical trials, rufinamide tablets discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every 2 days.5.6\tStatus EpilepticusEstimates of the incidence of treatment emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with rufinamide tablets are difficult because standard definitions were not employed. In a controlled Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome trial, 3 of 74 (4.1%) rufinamide tablet-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus in the rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared with none of the 64 patients in the placebo-treated patients. In all controlled trials that included patients with different epilepsies, 11 of 1240 (0.9%) rufinamide tablet-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus compared with none of 635 patients in the placebo-treated patients.5.7\tLeukopeniaRufinamide tablet has been shown to reduce white cell count. Leukopenia (white cell count < 3X109L) was more commonly observed in rufinamide tablet-treated patients 43 of 1171 (3.7%) than placebo-treated patients, 7 of 579 (1.2%) in all controlled trials.\n5.1\tSuicidal Behavior and IdeationAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including rufinamide tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono-and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.Table 1: Absolute and Relative Risk of Suicidal Behavior and IdeationIndicationPlacebo Patients with Events Per 1000 PatientsDrug Patients with Events Per 1000 PatientsRelative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo PatientsRisk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000PatientsEpilepsy13.43.52.4Psychiatric5.78.51.52.9Other11.81.90.9Total2.44.31.81.9The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.Anyone considering prescribing rufinamide tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.5.2\tCentral Nervous System ReactionsUse of rufinamide tablets has been associated with central nervous system-related adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial of patients 4 years or older with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The most significant of these can be classified into two general categories: 1) somnolence or fatigue, and 2) coordination abnormalities, dizziness, gait disturbances, and ataxia.Somnolence was reported in 24% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 13% of patients on placebo, and led to study discontinuation in 3% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 0% of patients on placebo. Fatigue was reported in 10% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 8% of patients on placebo patients. It led to study discontinuation in 1% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients and 0% of patients on placebo patients.Dizziness was reported in 2.7% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients compared to 0% of patients on placebo, and did not lead to study discontinuation.Ataxia and gait disturbance were reported in 5.4% and 1.4% of rufinamide tablet-treated patients, respectively, compared to no patient on placebo. None of these reactions led to study discontinuation.Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on rufinamide tablet to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.5.3\tQT ShorteningFormal cardiac ECG studies demonstrated shortening of the QT interval (mean=20 msec, for doses >2400 mg twice daily) with rufinamide tablets. In a placebo-controlled study of the QT interval, a higher percentage of rufinamide tablet-treated subjects (46% at 2400 mg, 46% at 3200 mg, and 65% at 4800 mg) had a QT shortening of greater than 20 msec\u00a0 at Tmaxcompared to placebo (5 to 10%).Reductions of the QT interval below 300 msec were not observed in the formal QT studies with doses up to 7200 mg per day. Moreover, there was no signal for drug-induced sudden death or ventricular arrhythmias.The degree of QT shortening induced by rufinamide tablets is without any known clinical risk. Familial Short QT syndrome is associated with an increased risk of sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation. Such events in this syndrome are believed to occur primarily when the corrected QT interval falls below 300 msec. Non-clinical data also indicate that QT shortening is associated with ventricular fibrillation.Patients with Familial Short QT syndrome should not be treated with rufinamide tablets. Caution should be used when administering rufinamide tablet with other drugs that shorten the QT interval[seeContraindications (4)].5.4\tMulti-organ Hypersensitivity/Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic     Symptoms (DRESS)Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including rufinamide tablets. DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection.

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS": "The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:Suicidal Behavior and Ideation[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]Central Nervous System Reactions[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)]QT Shortening[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3)]Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity/Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4)]Leukopenia[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.7)]6.1\tClinical Trials ExperienceBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.Adverse Reactions in Adult and Pediatric Patients ages 3 to 17 years of ageIn the pooled, double-blind, adjunctive therapy studies in adult and pediatric patients ages 3 to 17 years of age, the most common (\u226510%) adverse reactions in rufinamide tablet-treated patients, in all doses studied (200 to 3200 mg per day) with a higher frequency than in patients on placebo were: headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, and nausea.Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of pediatric patients (ages 3 to less than 17 years) with epilepsy treated with rufinamide tablets in controlled adjunctive studies and were numerically more common in patients treated with rufinamide tablets than in patients on placebo.At the target dose of 45 mg/kg per day for adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (ages 3 to less than 17 years), the most common (\u22653%) adverse reactions with an incidence greater than in placebo for rufinamide tablets were somnolence, vomiting, and headache.Table 2: Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients (Ages 3 to less than 17 years) in Pooled Double-Blind Adjunctive TrialsAdverse ReactionRufinamide Tablet\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (N=187)%Placebo (N=182)%Somnolence179Vomiting177Headache168Fatigue98Dizziness86Nausea73Influenza54Nasopharyngitis53Decreased Appetite52Rash42Ataxia41Diplopia41Bronchitis32Sinusitis32Psychomotor Hyperactivity31Upper Abdominal Pain32Aggression32Ear Infection31Disturbance in Attention31Pruritis30Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of adult patients with epilepsy treated with rufinamide tablets (up to 3200 mg per day) in adjunctive controlled studies and were numerically more common in patients treated with rufinamide tablets than in patients on placebo.

Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 (8 %) rufinamide tablet-treated patients and with a higher frequency than in the AED comparator group were: vomiting (24%), somnolence (16%), bronchitis (12%), constipation (12%), cough (12%), decreased appetite (12%), rash (12%), otitis media (8%), pneumonia (8%), decreased weight (8%), gastroenteritis (8%), nasal congestion (8%), and pneumonia aspiration (8%).Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical TrialsRufinamide tablet has been administered to 1978 individuals during all epilepsy clinical trials (placebo-controlled and open-label). Adverse reactions occurring during these studies were recorded by the investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of patients having adverse reactions, these events were grouped into standardized categories using the MedDRA dictionary. Adverse events occurring at least three times and considered possibly related to treatment are included in the System Organ Class listings below. Terms not included in the listings are those already included in the tables above, those too general to be informative, those related to procedures, and terms describing events common in the population. Some events occurring fewer than 3 times are also included based on their medical significance. Because the reports include events observed in open-label, uncontrolled observations, the role of rufinamide tablet in their causation cannot be reliably determined.Events are classified by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency as follows:frequent adverse events\u2014those occurring in at least 1/100 patients;infrequent adverse events\u2014those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients;rare\u2014those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:Frequent: anemia.Infrequent: lymphadenopathy, leukopenia, neutropenia, iron deficiency anemia, thrombocytopenia.Cardiac Disorders:Infrequent:bundle branch block right, atrioventricular block first degree. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders:Frequent:decreased appetite, increased appetite.Renal and Urinary Disorders:Frequent:pollakiuria.Infrequent:urinary incontinence, dysuria, hematuria, nephrolithiasis, polyuria, enuresis, nocturia, incontinence.6.2\tPostmarketing ExperienceThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of rufinamide tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.Dermatologic:Stevens-Johnson syndrome and other serious skin rashes with mucosal involvement.\nThe following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:Suicidal Behavior and Ideation[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]Central Nervous System Reactions[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)]QT Shortening[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3)]Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity/Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4)]Leukopenia[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.7)]6.1\tClinical Trials ExperienceBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.Adverse Reactions in Adult and Pediatric Patients ages 3 to 17 years of ageIn the pooled, double-blind, adjunctive therapy studies in adult and pediatric patients ages 3 to 17 years of age, the most common (\u226510%) adverse reactions in rufinamide tablet-treated patients, in all doses studied (200 to 3200 mg per day) with a higher frequency than in patients on placebo were: headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, and nausea.Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of pediatric patients (ages 3 to less than 17 years) with epilepsy treated with rufinamide tablets in controlled adjunctive studies and were numerically more common in patients treated with rufinamide tablets than in patients on placebo.At the target dose of 45 mg/kg per day for adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (ages 3 to less than 17 years), the most common (\u22653%) adverse reactions with an incidence greater than in placebo for rufinamide tablets were somnolence, vomiting, and headache.Table 2: Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients (Ages 3 to less than 17 years) in Pooled Double-Blind Adjunctive TrialsAdverse ReactionRufinamide Tablet\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (N=187)%Placebo (N=182)%Somnolence179Vomiting177Headache168Fatigue98Dizziness86Nausea73Influenza54Nasopharyngitis53Decreased Appetite52Rash42Ataxia41Diplopia41Bronchitis32Sinusitis32Psychomotor Hyperactivity31Upper Abdominal Pain32Aggression32Ear Infection31Disturbance in Attention31Pruritis30Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of adult patients with epilepsy treated with rufinamide tablets (up to 3200 mg per day) in adjunctive controlled studies and were numerically more common in patients treated with rufinamide tablets than in patients on placebo.

Adverse reactions occurring during these studies were recorded by the investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of patients having adverse reactions, these events were grouped into standardized categories using the MedDRA dictionary. Adverse events occurring at least three times and considered possibly related to treatment are included in the System Organ Class listings below. Terms not included in the listings are those already included in the tables above, those too general to be informative, those related to procedures, and terms describing events common in the population. Some events occurring fewer than 3 times are also included based on their medical significance.

    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS": "7.1\tEffects of Rufinamide Tablet on other AEDsPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of average concentration at steady state of carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, and valproate showed that typical rufinamide Cavsslevels had little effect on the pharmacokinetics of other AEDs. Any effects, when they occur, have been more marked in the pediatric population.Table 6 summarizes the drug-drug interactions of rufinamide tablets with other AEDs.Table 6: Summary of drug-drug interactions of rufinamide Tablets with other antiepileptic drugsAEDCo-administeredInfluence of Rufinamide on AED concentrationa)Influence of AED on Rufinamide concentrationCarbamazepineDecrease by 7 to 13%b)Decrease by 19 to 26%Dependent on dose of carbamazepineLamotrigineDecrease by 7 to 13%b)No EffectPhenobarbitalIncrease by 8 to 13%b)Decrease by 25 to 46%c),d)Independent of dose or concentration of phenobarbitalPhenytoinIncrease by 7 to 21%b)Decrease by 25 to 46%c),d)Independent of dose or concentration of phenytoinTopiramateNo EffectNo EffectValproateNo EffectIncrease by <16 to 70%c)Dependent on concentration of valproatePrimidoneNot InvestigatedDecrease by 25 to 46%c),d)Independent of dose or concentration of primidoneBenzodiazepinese)Not InvestigatedNo Effecta)Predictions are based on rufinamide tablet concentrations at the maximum recommended dose of rufinamide tablet.b)Maximum changes predicted to be in pediatric patients and in adult patients who achieve significantly higher levels of rufinamide tablets, as the effect of rufinamide on these AEDs is concentration-dependent.c)Larger effects in pediatric patients at high doses/concentrations of AEDs.d)Phenobarbital, primidone and phenytoin were treated as a single covariate (phenobarbital-type inducers) to examine the effect of these agents on rufinamide tablets clearance.e)All compounds of the benzodiazepine class were pooled to examine for \u2018class effect\u2019 on rufinamide tablets clearance.Phenytoin: The decrease in clearance of phenytoin estimated at typical levels of rufinamide (Cavss15 mcg/mL) is predicted to increase plasma levels of phenytoin by 7 to 21%. As phenytoin is known to have non-linear pharmacokinetics (clearance becomes saturated at higher doses), it is possible that exposure will be greater than the model prediction.7.2\tEffects of Other AEDs on Rufinamide TabletPotent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital, appear to increase the clearance of rufinamide tablets (see Table 6). Given that the majority of clearance of rufinamide tablets is via a non-CYP-dependent route, the observed decreases in blood levels seen with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone are unlikely to be entirely attributable to induction of a P450 enzyme. Other factors explaining this interaction are not understood. Any effects, where they occurred, were likely to be more marked in the pediatric population.ValproatePatients stabilized on rufinamide tablet before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose. Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide tablet dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults)[seeDosage and Administration (2.5),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].7.3\tEffects of Rufinamide Tablet on Hormonal ContraceptivesFemale patients of childbearing age should be warned that the concurrent use of rufinamide tablets with hormonal contraceptives may render this method of contraception less effective.

Other factors explaining this interaction are not understood. Any effects, where they occurred, were likely to be more marked in the pediatric population.ValproatePatients stabilized on rufinamide tablet before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyPregnancy Exposure RegistryThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as rufinamide tablets, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking rufinamide tablet during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org.Risk SummaryThere are no adequate data on the developmental risks associated with use of rufinamide tablets in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of rufinamide resulted in developmental toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits at clinically relevant doses[see Data].In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.DataAnimal dataOral administration of rufinamide (0, 20, 100, or 300 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal weight and increased incidence of fetal skeletal abnormalities at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, which were associated with maternal toxicity. The maternal plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-adverse effect dose (20 mg/kg/day) for developmental toxicity was less than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3200 mg/day.Oral administration of rufinamide (0, 30, 200, or 1000 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, decreased fetal body weight, and increased incidence of fetal visceral and skeletal abnormalities at doses of 200 and 1000 mg/kg/day. The high dose (1000 mg/kg/day) was associated with abortion. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-adverse effect dose (30 mg/kg/day) was less than that in humans at the MRHD.When rufinamide was orally administered (0, 5, 30, or 150 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats throughout pregnancy and lactation, decreased offspring growth and survival were observed at all doses tested. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development was not established. At the lowest dose tested (5 mg/kg/day), plasma exposure (AUC) was less than that in humans at the MRHD.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of rufinamide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for rufinamide tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from rufinamide tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialContraceptionUse of rufinamide tablets may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol or norethindrone. Advise women of reproductive potential taking rufinamide tablets who are using a contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone to use an additional non-hormonal form of contraception[seeDrug Interactions (7.3)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].InfertilityThe effect of rufinamide on fertility in humans has not been established. Oral administration of rufinamide (20, 60, 200, and 600 mg/kg/day) to male and female rats prior to mating, during mating, and during early gestation (females only) resulted in the impairment of fertility at all dose levels tested. The no-effect dose was not established. The plasma exposure level at 20 mg/kg was approximately 0.2 times the human plasma AUC at the MRHD[seeNonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age. The effectiveness of rufinamide tablets in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older was based upon an adequate and well-controlled trial of rufinamide tablets that included both adults and pediatric patients, 4 years of age and older, with Lennox Gastaut Syndrome. The effectiveness in patients 1 to less than 4 years was based upon a bridging pharmacokinetic and safety study[seeDosage and Administration (2.1),Adverse Reactions (6.1), andClinical Studies (14)].The pharmacokinetics of rufinamide in the pediatric patients, ages 1 to less than 4 years of age is similar to children older than 4 years of age and adults[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 year has not been established.Oral administration of rufinamide (0, 15, 50, or 150 mg/kg) to young rats for 10 weeks starting on postnatal day 7 resulted in decreased brain weights at the mid and high doses and neurobehavioral impairment (learning and memory deficit, altered startle response, decreased locomotor activity) and decreased growth (decreased body weight) at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development in rats (15 mg/kg) was associated with a plasma exposure (AUC) lower than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3200 mg/day.8.5 Geriatric UseClinical studies of rufinamide tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.Pharmacokinetics of rufinamide in the elderly are similar to that in the young subjects[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].8.6\tRenal ImpairmentRufinamide pharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) was similar to that of healthy subjects. Dose adjustment in patients undergoing dialysis should be considered[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].8.7\tHepatic ImpairmentUse of rufinamide tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 10 to 15) is not recommended. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with mild (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) to moderate (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment.\n8.1 PregnancyPregnancy Exposure RegistryThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as rufinamide tablets, during pregnancy.

Oral administration of rufinamide (20, 60, 200, and 600 mg/kg/day) to male and female rats prior to mating, during mating, and during early gestation (females only) resulted in the impairment of fertility at all dose levels tested. The no-effect dose was not established. The plasma exposure level at 20 mg/kg was approximately 0.2 times the human plasma AUC at the MRHD[seeNonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age. The effectiveness of rufinamide tablets in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older was based upon an adequate and well-controlled trial of rufinamide tablets that included both adults and pediatric patients, 4 years of age and older, with Lennox Gastaut Syndrome. The effectiveness in patients 1 to less than 4 years was based upon a bridging pharmacokinetic and safety study[seeDosage and Administration (2.1),Adverse Reactions (6.1), andClinical Studies (14)].The pharmacokinetics of rufinamide in the pediatric patients, ages 1 to less than 4 years of age is similar to children older than 4 years of age and adults[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 year has not been established.Oral administration of rufinamide (0, 15, 50, or 150 mg/kg) to young rats for 10 weeks starting on postnatal day 7 resulted in decreased brain weights at the mid and high doses and neurobehavioral impairment (learning and memory deficit, altered startle response, decreased locomotor activity) and decreased growth (decreased body weight) at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development in rats (15 mg/kg) was associated with a plasma exposure (AUC) lower than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3200 mg/day.8.5 Geriatric UseClinical studies of rufinamide tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.Pharmacokinetics of rufinamide in the elderly are similar to that in the young subjects[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].8.6\tRenal ImpairmentRufinamide pharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) was similar to that of healthy subjects. Dose adjustment in patients undergoing dialysis should be considered[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].8.7\tHepatic ImpairmentUse of rufinamide tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 10 to 15) is not recommended. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with mild (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) to moderate (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment.\n8.1 PregnancyPregnancy Exposure RegistryThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as rufinamide tablets, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking rufinamide tablet during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org.Risk SummaryThere are no adequate data on the developmental risks associated with use of rufinamide tablets in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of rufinamide resulted in developmental toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits at clinically relevant doses[see Data].In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.DataAnimal dataOral administration of rufinamide (0, 20, 100, or 300 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal weight and increased incidence of fetal skeletal abnormalities at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, which were associated with maternal toxicity. The maternal plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-adverse effect dose (20 mg/kg/day) for developmental toxicity was less than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3200 mg/day.Oral administration of rufinamide (0, 30, 200, or 1000 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, decreased fetal body weight, and increased incidence of fetal visceral and skeletal abnormalities at doses of 200 and 1000 mg/kg/day. The high dose (1000 mg/kg/day) was associated with abortion. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-adverse effect dose (30 mg/kg/day) was less than that in humans at the MRHD.When rufinamide was orally administered (0, 5, 30, or 150 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats throughout pregnancy and lactation, decreased offspring growth and survival were observed at all doses tested. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development was not established.

Dose adjustment in patients undergoing dialysis should be considered[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].8.7\tHepatic ImpairmentUse of rufinamide tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 10 to 15) is not recommended. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with mild (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) to moderate (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment.\n8.1 PregnancyPregnancy Exposure RegistryThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as rufinamide tablets, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking rufinamide tablet during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org.Risk SummaryThere are no adequate data on the developmental risks associated with use of rufinamide tablets in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of rufinamide resulted in developmental toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits at clinically relevant doses[see Data].In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.DataAnimal dataOral administration of rufinamide (0, 20, 100, or 300 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal weight and increased incidence of fetal skeletal abnormalities at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, which were associated with maternal toxicity. The maternal plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-adverse effect dose (20 mg/kg/day) for developmental toxicity was less than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3200 mg/day.Oral administration of rufinamide (0, 30, 200, or 1000 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, decreased fetal body weight, and increased incidence of fetal visceral and skeletal abnormalities at doses of 200 and 1000 mg/kg/day. The high dose (1000 mg/kg/day) was associated with abortion. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-adverse effect dose (30 mg/kg/day) was less than that in humans at the MRHD.When rufinamide was orally administered (0, 5, 30, or 150 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats throughout pregnancy and lactation, decreased offspring growth and survival were observed at all doses tested. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development was not established. At the lowest dose tested (5 mg/kg/day), plasma exposure (AUC) was less than that in humans at the MRHD.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of rufinamide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for rufinamide tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from rufinamide tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialContraceptionUse of rufinamide tablets may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol or norethindrone. Advise women of reproductive potential taking rufinamide tablets who are using a contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone to use an additional non-hormonal form of contraception[seeDrug Interactions (7.3)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].InfertilityThe effect of rufinamide on fertility in humans has not been established. Oral administration of rufinamide (20, 60, 200, and 600 mg/kg/day) to male and female rats prior to mating, during mating, and during early gestation (females only) resulted in the impairment of fertility at all dose levels tested. The no-effect dose was not established. The plasma exposure level at 20 mg/kg was approximately 0.2 times the human plasma AUC at the MRHD[seeNonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age. The effectiveness of rufinamide tablets in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older was based upon an adequate and well-controlled trial of rufinamide tablets that included both adults and pediatric patients, 4 years of age and older, with Lennox Gastaut Syndrome. The effectiveness in patients 1 to less than 4 years was based upon a bridging pharmacokinetic and safety study[seeDosage and Administration (2.1),Adverse Reactions (6.1), andClinical Studies (14)].The pharmacokinetics of rufinamide in the pediatric patients, ages 1 to less than 4 years of age is similar to children older than 4 years of age and adults[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 year has not been established.Oral administration of rufinamide (0, 15, 50, or 150 mg/kg) to young rats for 10 weeks starting on postnatal day 7 resulted in decreased brain weights at the mid and high doses and neurobehavioral impairment (learning and memory deficit, altered startle response, decreased locomotor activity) and decreased growth (decreased body weight) at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development in rats (15 mg/kg) was associated with a plasma exposure (AUC) lower than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3200 mg/day.8.5 Geriatric UseClinical studies of rufinamide tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.Pharmacokinetics of rufinamide in the elderly are similar to that in the young subjects[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].8.6\tRenal ImpairmentRufinamide pharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) was similar to that of healthy subjects. Dose adjustment in patients undergoing dialysis should be considered[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].8.7\tHepatic ImpairmentUse of rufinamide tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 10 to 15) is not recommended. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with mild (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) to moderate (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment.",

    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "12.1 Mechanism of ActionThe precise mechanism(s) by which rufinamide exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown.The results ofin vitrostudies suggest that the principal mechanism of action of rufinamide is modulation of the activity of sodium channels and, in particular, prolongation of the inactive state of the channel. Rufinamide (\u2265 1 \u00b5M) significantly slowed sodium channel recovery from inactivation after a prolonged prepulse in cultured cortical neurons, and limited sustained repetitive firing of sodium-dependent action potentials (EC50of 3.8 \u00b5M).12.3 PharmacokineticsOverviewRufinamide\u00a0oral suspension is bioequivalent on a mg per mg basis to rufinamide tablets. Rufinamide tablet is well absorbed after oral administration. However, the rate of absorption is relatively slow and the extent of absorption is decreased as dose is increased. The pharmacokinetics does not change with multiple dosing. Most elimination of rufinamide is via metabolism, with the primary metabolite resulting from enzymatic hydrolysis of the carboxamide moiety to form the carboxylic acid. This metabolic route is not cytochrome P450 dependent. There are no known active metabolites. Plasma half-life of rufinamide is approximately 6 to10 hours.Absorption and DistributionFollowing oral administration of rufinamide tablets, peak plasma concentrations occur between 4 and 6 hours (Tmax) both under fed and fasted conditions. Rufinamide tablet display decreasing bioavailability with increasing dose after single and multiple dose administration. Based on urinary excretion, the extent of absorption was at least 85% following oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg rufinamide tablet under fed conditions.Multiple dose pharmacokinetics can be predicted from single dose data for both rufinamide and its metabolite. Given the dosing frequency of every 12 hours and the half-life of 6 to 10 hours, the observed steady-state peak concentration of about two to three times the peak concentration after a single dose is expected.Food increased the extent of absorption of rufinamide in healthy volunteers by 34% and increased peak exposure by 56% after a single dose of 400 mg tablet, although the Tmaxwas not elevated[seeDosage and Administration (2.2)].Only a small fraction of rufinamide (34%) is bound to human serum proteins, predominantly to albumin (27%), giving little risk of displacement drug-drug interactions. Rufinamide was evenly distributed between erythrocytes and plasma. The apparent volume of distribution is dependent upon dose and varies with body surface area. The apparent volume of distribution was about 50 L at 3200 mg per day.MetabolismRufinamide is extensively metabolized but has no active metabolites. Following a radiolabeled dose of rufinamide, less than 2% of the dose was recovered unchanged in urine. The primary biotransformation pathway is carboxylesterase(s) mediated hydrolysis of the carboxamide group to the acid derivative CGP 47292. A few minor additional metabolites were detected in urine, which appeared to be acyl-glucuronides of CGP 47292. There is no involvement of oxidizing cytochrome P450 enzymes or glutathione in the biotransformation process.Rufinamide is a weak inhibitor of CYP 2E1. It did not show significant inhibition of other CYP enzymes. Rufinamide is a weak inducer of CYP 3A4 enzymes.Rufinamide did not show any significant inhibition of P-glycoprotein in anin vitrostudy.Elimination/ExcretionRenal excretion is the predominant route of elimination for drug related material, accounting for 85% of the dose based on a radiolabeled study. Of the metabolites identified in urine, at least 66% of the rufinamide dose was excreted as the acid metabolite CGP 47292, with 2% of the dose excreted as rufinamide.The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 6 to 10 hours in healthy subjects and patients with epilepsy.Special PopulationsAgePediatricsBased on a population analysis which included a total of 115 patients, including 85 pediatric patients (24 patients ages 1 to 3 years, 40 patients ages 4 to 11 years, and 21 patients ages 12 to 17 years), the pharmacokinetics of rufinamide was similar across all age groups.ElderlyThe results of a study evaluating single-dose (400 mg) and multiple dose (800 mg per day for 6 days) pharmacokinetics of rufinamide in 8 healthy elderly subjects (65 to 80 years old) and 7 younger healthy subjects (18 to 45 years old) found no significant age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of rufinamide.SexPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses of females show a 6 to 14% lower apparent clearance of rufinamide compared to males. This effect is not clinically important.RaceIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of clinical studies, no difference in clearance or volume of distribution of rufinamide was observed between the black and Caucasian subjects, after controlling for body size. Information on other races could not be obtained because of smaller numbers of these subjects.Renal ImpairmentRufinamide pharmacokinetics in 9 patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL per min) was similar to that of healthy subjects. Patients undergoing dialysis 3 hours post rufinamide dosing showed a reduction in AUC and Cmaxby 29% and 16%, respectively.Drug InteractionsBased onin vitrostudies, rufinamide shows little or no inhibition of most cytochrome P450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations, with weak inhibition of CYP 2E1. Drugs that are substrates of CYP 2E1 (e.g., chlorzoxazone) may have increased plasma levels in the presence of rufinamide, but this has not been studied.Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate. In pediatric patients, valproate administration may lead to elevated levels of rufinamide by up to 70%[seeDrug Interactions (7.2)].Based onin vivodrug interaction studies with triazolam and oral contraceptives, rufinamide is a weak inducer of the CYP 3A4 enzyme and can decrease exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP 3A4.Co-administration and pre-treatment of rufinamide tablets (400 mg twice daily) and triazolam resulted in a 37% decrease in AUC and a 23% decrease in Cmaxof triazolam, a CYP 3A4 substrate.Co-administration of rufinamide tablets (800 mg twice daily for 14 days) and Ortho-Novum 1/35\u00aeresulted in a mean decrease in the ethinyl estradiol AUC0 to 24of 22% and Cmaxby 31% and norethindrone AUC0 to 24by 14% and Cmaxby 18%, respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease is unknown[seeDrug Interactions (7.3)andUse in Specific Populations (8.3)].Rufinamide is metabolized by carboxylesterases. Drugs that may induce the activity of carboxylesterases may increase the clearance of rufinamide. Broad-spectrum inducers such as carbamazepine and phenobarbital may have minor effects on rufinamide metabolism via this mechanism. Drugs that are inhibitors of carboxylesterases may decrease metabolism of rufinamide.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionThe precise mechanism(s) by which rufinamide exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown.The results ofin vitrostudies suggest that the principal mechanism of action of rufinamide is modulation of the activity of sodium channels and, in particular, prolongation of the inactive state of the channel.

Following a radiolabeled dose of rufinamide, less than 2% of the dose was recovered unchanged in urine. The primary biotransformation pathway is carboxylesterase(s) mediated hydrolysis of the carboxamide group to the acid derivative CGP 47292. A few minor additional metabolites were detected in urine, which appeared to be acyl-glucuronides of CGP 47292. There is no involvement of oxidizing cytochrome P450 enzymes or glutathione in the biotransformation process.Rufinamide is a weak inhibitor of CYP 2E1. It did not show significant inhibition of other CYP enzymes. Rufinamide is a weak inducer of CYP 3A4 enzymes.Rufinamide did not show any significant inhibition of P-glycoprotein in anin vitrostudy.Elimination/ExcretionRenal excretion is the predominant route of elimination for drug related material, accounting for 85% of the dose based on a radiolabeled study. Of the metabolites identified in urine, at least 66% of the rufinamide dose was excreted as the acid metabolite CGP 47292, with 2% of the dose excreted as rufinamide.The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 6 to 10 hours in healthy subjects and patients with epilepsy.Special PopulationsAgePediatricsBased on a population analysis which included a total of 115 patients, including 85 pediatric patients (24 patients ages 1 to 3 years, 40 patients ages 4 to 11 years, and 21 patients ages 12 to 17 years), the pharmacokinetics of rufinamide was similar across all age groups.ElderlyThe results of a study evaluating single-dose (400 mg) and multiple dose (800 mg per day for 6 days) pharmacokinetics of rufinamide in 8 healthy elderly subjects (65 to 80 years old) and 7 younger healthy subjects (18 to 45 years old) found no significant age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of rufinamide.SexPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses of females show a 6 to 14% lower apparent clearance of rufinamide compared to males. This effect is not clinically important.RaceIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of clinical studies, no difference in clearance or volume of distribution of rufinamide was observed between the black and Caucasian subjects, after controlling for body size. Information on other races could not be obtained because of smaller numbers of these subjects.Renal ImpairmentRufinamide pharmacokinetics in 9 patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL per min) was similar to that of healthy subjects. Patients undergoing dialysis 3 hours post rufinamide dosing showed a reduction in AUC and Cmaxby 29% and 16%, respectively.Drug InteractionsBased onin vitrostudies, rufinamide shows little or no inhibition of most cytochrome P450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations, with weak inhibition of CYP 2E1. Drugs that are substrates of CYP 2E1 (e.g., chlorzoxazone) may have increased plasma levels in the presence of rufinamide, but this has not been studied.Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate. In pediatric patients, valproate administration may lead to elevated levels of rufinamide by up to 70%[seeDrug Interactions (7.2)].Based onin vivodrug interaction studies with triazolam and oral contraceptives, rufinamide is a weak inducer of the CYP 3A4 enzyme and can decrease exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP 3A4.Co-administration and pre-treatment of rufinamide tablets (400 mg twice daily) and triazolam resulted in a 37% decrease in AUC and a 23% decrease in Cmaxof triazolam, a CYP 3A4 substrate.Co-administration of rufinamide tablets (800 mg twice daily for 14 days) and Ortho-Novum 1/35\u00aeresulted in a mean decrease in the ethinyl estradiol AUC0 to 24of 22% and Cmaxby 31% and norethindrone AUC0 to 24by 14% and Cmaxby 18%, respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease is unknown[seeDrug Interactions (7.3)andUse in Specific Populations (8.3)].Rufinamide is metabolized by carboxylesterases. Drugs that may induce the activity of carboxylesterases may increase the clearance of rufinamide. Broad-spectrum inducers such as carbamazepine and phenobarbital may have minor effects on rufinamide metabolism via this mechanism. Drugs that are inhibitors of carboxylesterases may decrease metabolism of rufinamide.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionThe precise mechanism(s) by which rufinamide exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown.The results ofin vitrostudies suggest that the principal mechanism of action of rufinamide is modulation of the activity of sodium channels and, in particular, prolongation of the inactive state of the channel. Rufinamide (\u2265 1 \u00b5M) significantly slowed sodium channel recovery from inactivation after a prolonged prepulse in cultured cortical neurons, and limited sustained repetitive firing of sodium-dependent action potentials (EC50of 3.8 \u00b5M).12.3 PharmacokineticsOverviewRufinamide\u00a0oral suspension is bioequivalent on a mg per mg basis to rufinamide tablets. Rufinamide tablet is well absorbed after oral administration. However, the rate of absorption is relatively slow and the extent of absorption is decreased as dose is increased. The pharmacokinetics does not change with multiple dosing. Most elimination of rufinamide is via metabolism, with the primary metabolite resulting from enzymatic hydrolysis of the carboxamide moiety to form the carboxylic acid. This metabolic route is not cytochrome P450 dependent. There are no known active metabolites. Plasma half-life of rufinamide is approximately 6 to10 hours.Absorption and DistributionFollowing oral administration of rufinamide tablets, peak plasma concentrations occur between 4 and 6 hours (Tmax) both under fed and fasted conditions. Rufinamide tablet display decreasing bioavailability with increasing dose after single and multiple dose administration. Based on urinary excretion, the extent of absorption was at least 85% following oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg rufinamide tablet under fed conditions.Multiple dose pharmacokinetics can be predicted from single dose data for both rufinamide and its metabolite. Given the dosing frequency of every 12 hours and the half-life of 6 to 10 hours, the observed steady-state peak concentration of about two to three times the peak concentration after a single dose is expected.Food increased the extent of absorption of rufinamide in healthy volunteers by 34% and increased peak exposure by 56% after a single dose of 400 mg tablet, although the Tmaxwas not elevated[seeDosage and Administration (2.2)].Only a small fraction of rufinamide (34%) is bound to human serum proteins, predominantly to albumin (27%), giving little risk of displacement drug-drug interactions.

    "14 CLINICAL STUDIES": "Adult and Pediatric Patients ages 4 years and olderThe effectiveness of rufinamide tablet as adjunctive treatment for the seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) in adult and pediatric patients ages 4 years and older was established in a single multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled,\u00a0 randomized, parallel-group\u00a0 study (N=138). Male and female patients (between 4 and 30 years of age) were included if they had a diagnosis of inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS (including both atypical absence seizures and drop attacks) and were being treated with 1 to 3 concomitant stable dose AEDs. Each patient must have had at least 90 seizures in the month prior to study entry. After completing a 4-week Baseline Phase on stable therapy, patients were randomized to have rufinamide tablet or placebo added to their ongoing therapy during the 12 -week Double-blind Phase. The Double- blind Phase consisted of 2 periods: the Titration Period (1 to 2 weeks) and the Maintenance Period (10 weeks). During the Titration Period, the dose was increased to a target dosage of approximately 45 mg/kg per day (3200 mg in adults of \u2265 70 kg), given on a twice daily schedule. Dosage reductions were permitted during titration if problems in tolerability were encountered. Final doses at titration were to remain stable during the maintenance period. Target dosage was achieved in 88% of the rufinamide tablet-treated patients. The majority of these patients reached the target dose within 7 days, with the remaining patients achieving the target dose within 14 days.The primary efficacy variables were:The percent change in total seizure frequency per 28 days;The percent change in tonic-atonic (drop attacks) seizure frequency per 28 days;Seizure severity from the Parent/Guardian Global Evaluation of the patient\u2019s condition. This was a 7-point assessment performed at the end of the Double-blind Phase. A score of +3 indicated that the patient\u2019s seizure severity was very much improved, a score of 0 that the seizure severity was unchanged, and a score of -3 that the seizure severity was very much worse.The results of the three primary endpoints are shown in Table 7 below.Table 7: Lennox -Gastaut Syndrome Trial Seizure Frequency Primary Efficacy Variable ResultsVariablePlaceboRufinamideMedian percent change in total seizure frequency per 28 days-11.7-32.7 (p=0.0015)Median percent change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days1.4-42.5 (p<0.0001)Improvement in Seizure Severity Rating from Global Evaluation30.653.4 (p=0.0041)Pediatric Patients ages 1 to less than 4 yearsThe effectiveness of rufinamide tablets as adjunctive treatment for the seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in pediatric patients ages 1 year to less than 4 years was established based on a single multi-center, open-label, active-controlled, randomized, pharmacokinetic bridging study.

The pharmacokinetic profile of rufinamide tablet is not significantly affected by age either as a continuous covariate (1 to 35 years) or as a categorical covariate (age categories: 1 to less than 4 years and 4 years of age and older), after body weight is taken into consideration.\nAdult and Pediatric Patients ages 4 years and olderThe effectiveness of rufinamide tablet as adjunctive treatment for the seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) in adult and pediatric patients ages 4 years and older was established in a single multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled,\u00a0 randomized, parallel-group\u00a0 study (N=138). Male and female patients (between 4 and 30 years of age) were included if they had a diagnosis of inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS (including both atypical absence seizures and drop attacks) and were being treated with 1 to 3 concomitant stable dose AEDs. Each patient must have had at least 90 seizures in the month prior to study entry. After completing a 4-week Baseline Phase on stable therapy, patients were randomized to have rufinamide tablet or placebo added to their ongoing therapy during the 12 -week Double-blind Phase. The Double- blind Phase consisted of 2 periods: the Titration Period (1 to 2 weeks) and the Maintenance Period (10 weeks). During the Titration Period, the dose was increased to a target dosage of approximately 45 mg/kg per day (3200 mg in adults of \u2265 70 kg), given on a twice daily schedule. Dosage reductions were permitted during titration if problems in tolerability were encountered. Final doses at titration were to remain stable during the maintenance period. Target dosage was achieved in 88% of the rufinamide tablet-treated patients. The majority of these patients reached the target dose within 7 days, with the remaining patients achieving the target dose within 14 days.The primary efficacy variables were:The percent change in total seizure frequency per 28 days;The percent change in tonic-atonic (drop attacks) seizure frequency per 28 days;Seizure severity from the Parent/Guardian Global Evaluation of the patient\u2019s condition. This was a 7-point assessment performed at the end of the Double-blind Phase. A score of +3 indicated that the patient\u2019s seizure severity was very much improved, a score of 0 that the seizure severity was unchanged, and a score of -3 that the seizure severity was very much worse.The results of the three primary endpoints are shown in Table 7 below.Table 7: Lennox -Gastaut Syndrome Trial Seizure Frequency Primary Efficacy Variable ResultsVariablePlaceboRufinamideMedian percent change in total seizure frequency per 28 days-11.7-32.7 (p=0.0015)Median percent change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days1.4-42.5 (p<0.0001)Improvement in Seizure Severity Rating from Global Evaluation30.653.4 (p=0.0041)Pediatric Patients ages 1 to less than 4 yearsThe effectiveness of rufinamide tablets as adjunctive treatment for the seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in pediatric patients ages 1 year to less than 4 years was established based on a single multi-center, open-label, active-controlled, randomized, pharmacokinetic bridging study.
