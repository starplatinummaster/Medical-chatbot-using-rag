Symptoms included malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL. (5.1)Risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs, age \u2265 65 years old, radiological studies with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information. (5.1)If lactic acidosis is suspected, discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended. (5.1)INDICATIONS AND USAGEMetformin hydrochloride\u00a0is a biguanide indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus. (1)DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONAdult Dosage for Metformin Hydrochloride Oral Solution:Starting dose: 500 mg (5 mL) orally twice a day or 850 mg (8.5 mL) once a day, with meals (2.1)Increase the dose in increments of 500 mg (5 mL) weekly or 850 mg (8.5 mL) every 2 weeks, up to a maximum dose of 2,550 mg (25.5 mL) per day, given in divided doses (2.1)Doses above 2,000 mg (20 mL) may be better tolerated given in divided doses 3 times a day with meals (2.1)Pediatric Dosage for Metformin Hydrochloride Oral Solution:Starting dose: 500 mg (5 mL) orally twice a day, with meals (2.2)Increase dosage in increments of 500 mg (5 mL) weekly up to a maximum of 2,000 mg (20 mL) per day, given in divided doses twice daily (2.2)Renal Impairment:Prior to initiation, assess renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (2.3)Do not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2(2.3)Initiation is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2(2.3)Assess risk/benefit of continuing metformin hydrochloride oral solution if eGFR falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2(2.3)Discontinue if eGFR falls below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2(2.3)Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures:Metformin hydrochloride oral solution\u00a0may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures (2.4)DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHSOral Solution: 500 mg per 5 mL (100 mg/mL) in strawberry flavor (3)CONTRAINDICATIONSSevere renal impairment (eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) (4,5.1)Hypersensitivity to metformin (4)Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. (4)WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSLactic acidosis:See boxed warning. (5.1)Vitamin B12deficiency:Metformin may lower vitamin B12levels. Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12at 2 to 3-year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2)Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues:Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3)ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache. (6.1)To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact\u00a0Saptalis Pharmaceuticals, LLC at\u00a01-833-727-8254 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatchDRUG INTERACTIONSCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors may increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring (7)Drugs that reduce metformin clearance (such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) may increase the accumulation of metformin. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use (7)Alcohol can potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake (7)USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSFemales and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy.

    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1 Lactic AcidosisThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution. In metformin hydrochloride oral solution-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:Renal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [seeDosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:Before initiating metformin hydrochloride oral solution, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).Metformin hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[seeContraindications (4)].Initiation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride oral solution. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.In patients taking metformin hydrochloride oral solution whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.Drug interactions\u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients[see Drug Interactions (7)].Age 65 or greater\u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride oral solution at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra- arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride oral solution if renal function is stable.Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution.Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride oral solution.Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.5.2 Vitamin B12DeficiencyIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin hydrochloride (HCl) tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12at 2 to 3-year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride oral solution and manage any abnormalities [seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin SecretagoguesInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia.\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride oral solution may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with\u00a0metformin hydrochloride oral solution[see Drug Interactions (7)].5.4 Macrovascular OutcomesThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride oral solution.\n5.1 Lactic AcidosisThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases.

Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.5.2 Vitamin B12DeficiencyIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin hydrochloride (HCl) tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12at 2 to 3-year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride oral solution and manage any abnormalities [seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin SecretagoguesInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia.\u00a0Metformin hydrochloride oral solution may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with\u00a0metformin hydrochloride oral solution[see Drug Interactions (7)].5.4 Macrovascular OutcomesThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride oral solution.\n5.1 Lactic AcidosisThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution. In metformin hydrochloride oral solution-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:Renal impairment\u2014The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [seeDosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:Before initiating metformin hydrochloride oral solution, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).Metformin hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[seeContraindications (4)].Initiation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride oral solution. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.In patients taking metformin hydrochloride oral solution whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.Drug interactions\u2014 The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients[see Drug Interactions (7)].Age 65 or greater\u2014 The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride oral solution at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra- arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride oral solution if renal function is stable.Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution.Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride oral solution.Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.5.2 Vitamin B12DeficiencyIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin hydrochloride (HCl) tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryLimited data with metformin hydrochloride oral solution in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk[see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy[see Clinical Considerations].No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 5-times, respectively, a 2,550 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area[see Data].The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1C >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a HbA1C >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal riskPoorly-controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity.DataHuman DataPublished data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin- associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.Animal DataMetformin hydrochloride did not adversely affect development outcomes when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about 2 and 5 times a 2,550 mg clinical dose based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryLimited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk[see Data]. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metformin hydrochloride oral solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from metformin hydrochloride oral solution or from the underlying maternal condition.DataPublished clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants.8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialDiscuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin hydrochloride oral solution may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women.8.4 Pediatric UseThe safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride oral solution for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old. Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride oral solution have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years old.Use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of metformin HCl tablets in adults with additional data from a controlled clinical study of metformin HCl tablets in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which demonstrated a similar response in glycemic control to that seen in adults[see Clinical Studies (14)]. In this study, adverse reactions were similar to those described in adults. A maximum daily dose of 2,000 mg of metformin hydrochloride oral solution is recommended. [SeeDosage and Administration (2.2).]8.5 Geriatric UseControlled clinical studies of metformin HCl tablets did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].8.6 Renal ImpairmentMetformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[seeDosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].8.7 Hepatic ImpairmentUse of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment\u00a0[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryLimited data with metformin hydrochloride oral solution in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage.

However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin- associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.Animal DataMetformin hydrochloride did not adversely affect development outcomes when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about 2 and 5 times a 2,550 mg clinical dose based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryLimited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk[see Data]. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metformin hydrochloride oral solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from metformin hydrochloride oral solution or from the underlying maternal condition.DataPublished clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants.8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialDiscuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin hydrochloride oral solution may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women.8.4 Pediatric UseThe safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride oral solution for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old. Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride oral solution have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years old.Use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of metformin HCl tablets in adults with additional data from a controlled clinical study of metformin HCl tablets in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which demonstrated a similar response in glycemic control to that seen in adults[see Clinical Studies (14)]. In this study, adverse reactions were similar to those described in adults. A maximum daily dose of 2,000 mg of metformin hydrochloride oral solution is recommended. [SeeDosage and Administration (2.2).]8.5 Geriatric UseControlled clinical studies of metformin HCl tablets did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].8.6 Renal ImpairmentMetformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[seeDosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].8.7 Hepatic ImpairmentUse of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis.

    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "12.1 Mechanism of ActionMetformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorptionTwo pharmacokinetic studies performed in healthy volunteers to evaluate the bioavailability of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in comparison with metformin HCl tablets under fasting and fed conditions showed that the rate and extent of absorption of metformin hydrochloride oral solution was found to be comparable to that of metformin HCl tablets under fasting or fed conditions (see Table 3).Table 3: Select Mean (\u00b1 S.D.)

At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally < 1 mcg/mL.Effect of food:The food-effect study assessed the effects of a high fat/high calorie meal and a low fat/low calorie meal on the bioavailability of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in comparison with administration in the fasted state, in healthy volunteers. The extent of absorption was increased by approximately 16% and 13% with the low fat/low calorie meal and the high fat/high calorie meal, respectively, compared with the administration in the fasted state. The rate and extent of absorption with high fat/high calorie and low fat/ low calorie meal were similar. The mean tmaxwas 2.5 hours under fasting conditions as compared to 3.9 hours with both low fat/ low calorie meal and high fat/high calorie meals (see Table 4).Table 4: Select Mean (\u00b1 S.D.)

Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.MetabolismIntravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion.EliminationRenal clearance (see Table 5) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.Specific PopulationsRenal ImpairmentIn patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased (see Table 5) [SeeDosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].Hepatic ImpairmentNo pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment [SeeWarnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].GeriatricsLimited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin HCl tablets in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmaxis increased, compared to healthy young subjects. It appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see Table 5).

With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorptionTwo pharmacokinetic studies performed in healthy volunteers to evaluate the bioavailability of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in comparison with metformin HCl tablets under fasting and fed conditions showed that the rate and extent of absorption of metformin hydrochloride oral solution was found to be comparable to that of metformin HCl tablets under fasting or fed conditions (see Table 3).Table 3: Select Mean (\u00b1 S.D.)

At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally < 1 mcg/mL.Effect of food:The food-effect study assessed the effects of a high fat/high calorie meal and a low fat/low calorie meal on the bioavailability of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in comparison with administration in the fasted state, in healthy volunteers. The extent of absorption was increased by approximately 16% and 13% with the low fat/low calorie meal and the high fat/high calorie meal, respectively, compared with the administration in the fasted state. The rate and extent of absorption with high fat/high calorie and low fat/ low calorie meal were similar. The mean tmaxwas 2.5 hours under fasting conditions as compared to 3.9 hours with both low fat/ low calorie meal and high fat/high calorie meals (see Table 4).Table 4: Select Mean (\u00b1 S.D.)

Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.MetabolismIntravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion.EliminationRenal clearance (see Table 5) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.Specific PopulationsRenal ImpairmentIn patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased (see Table 5) [SeeDosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].Hepatic ImpairmentNo pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment [SeeWarnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].GeriatricsLimited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin HCl tablets in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmaxis increased, compared to healthy young subjects. It appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see Table 5).

Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorptionTwo pharmacokinetic studies performed in healthy volunteers to evaluate the bioavailability of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in comparison with metformin HCl tablets under fasting and fed conditions showed that the rate and extent of absorption of metformin hydrochloride oral solution was found to be comparable to that of metformin HCl tablets under fasting or fed conditions (see Table 3).Table 3: Select Mean (\u00b1 S.D.)

At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally < 1 mcg/mL.Effect of food:The food-effect study assessed the effects of a high fat/high calorie meal and a low fat/low calorie meal on the bioavailability of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in comparison with administration in the fasted state, in healthy volunteers. The extent of absorption was increased by approximately 16% and 13% with the low fat/low calorie meal and the high fat/high calorie meal, respectively, compared with the administration in the fasted state. The rate and extent of absorption with high fat/high calorie and low fat/ low calorie meal were similar. The mean tmaxwas 2.5 hours under fasting conditions as compared to 3.9 hours with both low fat/ low calorie meal and high fat/high calorie meals (see Table 4).Table 4: Select Mean (\u00b1 S.D.)

Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.MetabolismIntravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion.EliminationRenal clearance (see Table 5) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.Specific PopulationsRenal ImpairmentIn patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased (see Table 5) [SeeDosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].Hepatic ImpairmentNo pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment [SeeWarnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].GeriatricsLimited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin HCl tablets in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmaxis increased, compared to healthy young subjects. It appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see Table 5).

Patients randomized to the combination arm started therapy with metformin HCl tablet 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg. At the end of each week of the first 4 weeks of the trial, these patients had their dosages of metformin HCl increased by 500 mg if they had failed to reach target fasting plasma glucose. After week 4, such dosage adjustments were made monthly, although no patient was allowed to exceed metformin HCl 2,500 mg. Patients in the metformin only arm (metformin HCl plus placebo) discontinued glyburide and followed the same titration schedule. Patients in the glyburide arm continued the same dose of glyburide. At the end of the trial, approximately 70% of the patients in the combination group were taking metformin HCl 2,000 mg/glyburide 20 mg or metformin HCl 2,500 mg/glyburide 20 mg.
