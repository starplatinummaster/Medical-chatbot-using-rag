Symptoms included malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL.(5.1)Risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs, age \u2265 65 years old, radiological studies with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information.(5.1)If lactic acidosis is suspected, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended.(5.1)INDICATIONS AND USAGEMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is a biguanide indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. (1)DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONStarting dose: 500 mg orally once daily with the evening meal (2.1)Increase the dose in increments of 500 mg every 1 to 2 weeks, up to a maximum of 2,000 mg once daily with the evening meal. (2.1)Patients receiving metformin hydrochloride (HCl) tablets may be switched to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2,000 mg once daily. (2.1)Swallow metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole and never crush, cut or chew. (2.1)Renal Impairment:Prior to initiation, assess renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). (2.2)Do not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2.Initiation is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2.Assess risk/benefit of continuing metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if eGFR falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2.Discontinue if eGFR falls below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2.Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures:Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures. (2.3)DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHSMetformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets: 500 mg and 1,000 mg (3)CONTRAINDICATIONSSevere renal impairment: (eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2) (4,5.1)Known hypersensitivity to metformin (4)Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma (4)WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSLactic Acidosis:See boxed warning. (5.1)Vitamin B12Deficiency:Metformin may lower vitamin B12levels. Monitor hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2)Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues:Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. (5.3)ADVERSE REACTIONSAdverse reactions occurring >5% in metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets clinical trials: hypoglycemia, diarrhea, and nausea.

    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1\tLactic AcidosisThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:Renal Impairment:The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include[seeDosage and Administration ( 2.2 )andClinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]:Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2[seeContraindications ( 4 )].Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2.Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.Drug Interactions:The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin\u00ad associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation[seeDrug Interactions ( 7 )].Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.Age 65 or Greater:The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients[seeUse in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )].Radiological Studies with Contrast:Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin\u00adtreated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.Surgery and Other Procedures:Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.Hypoxic States:Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.Excessive Alcohol Intake:Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism, and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.Hepatic Impairment:Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.5.2 Vitamin B12DeficiencyIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities[seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin SecretagoguesInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets[seeDrug Interactions (7)].5.4\tMacrovascular OutcomesThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n5.1\tLactic AcidosisThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases.

Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:Renal Impairment:The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include[seeDosage and Administration ( 2.2 )andClinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]:Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2[seeContraindications ( 4 )].Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2.Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.Drug Interactions:The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin\u00ad associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation[seeDrug Interactions ( 7 )].Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.Age 65 or Greater:The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients[seeUse in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )].Radiological Studies with Contrast:Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin\u00adtreated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.Surgery and Other Procedures:Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.Hypoxic States:Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.Excessive Alcohol Intake:Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism, and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.Hepatic Impairment:Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.5.2 Vitamin B12DeficiencyIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities[seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin SecretagoguesInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets[seeDrug Interactions (7)].5.4\tMacrovascular OutcomesThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n5.1\tLactic AcidosisThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions).

In the add-on to sulfonylurea study, patients receiving background glyburide therapy were randomized to receive add-on treatment of either one of three different regimens of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo. In total, 431 patients received metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and glyburide and 144 patients received placebo and glyburide.

    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS": "Table 2 presents clinically significant drug interactions with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release TabletsCarbonic Anhydrase InhibitorsClinical Impact:Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk for lactic acidosis.Intervention:Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients.Examples:Topiramate, zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide.Drugs that Reduce Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets ClearanceClinical Impact:Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT2] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis[seeClinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].Intervention:Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.Examples:Ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine.AlcoholClinical Impact:Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism.Intervention:Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.Insulin Secretagogues or InsulinClinical Impact:Coadministration of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.Intervention:Patients receiving an insulin secretagogue or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin.Drugs Affecting Glycemic ControlClinical Impact:Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control.Intervention:When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia.Examples:Thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockers, and isoniazid.\nTable 2 presents clinically significant drug interactions with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release TabletsCarbonic Anhydrase InhibitorsClinical Impact:Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryLimited data with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk[see Data].There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy[see Clinical Considerations].No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats\u00a0 and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 3 and 1 times, respectively, a 2,000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area[see Data].The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with an HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal riskPoorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.DataHuman DataPublished data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.Animal DataMetformin HCl was not teratogenic or embyrolethal when administered to rats prior to pregnancy through the period of organogenesis at doses up to 900 mg/kg, or when administered to rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 90 mg/kg.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryLimited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk[see Data].However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.DataPublished clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1.

Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment.[seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ).]\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryLimited data with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk[see Data].There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy[see Clinical Considerations].No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats\u00a0 and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 3 and 1 times, respectively, a 2,000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area[see Data].The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with an HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal riskPoorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.DataHuman DataPublished data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.Animal DataMetformin HCl was not teratogenic or embyrolethal when administered to rats prior to pregnancy through the period of organogenesis at doses up to 900 mg/kg, or when administered to rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 90 mg/kg.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryLimited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk[see Data].However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.DataPublished clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1.

    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "12.1 Mechanism of ActionMetformin is a biguanide that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorptionFollowing a single oral dose of 1,000 mg (2x500 mg tablets) metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets after a meal, the time to reach maximum plasma metformin concentration (Tmax) is achieved at approximately 7 to 8 hours. In both single- and multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects, once daily 1,000 mg (2x500 mg tablets) dosing provides equivalent systemic exposure, as measured by area under the curve (AUC), and up to 35% higher Cmax, of metformin relative to the immediate-release given as 500 mg twice daily. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL.In a two-way, single-dose, crossover study in healthy volunteers, the 1,000 mg tablet was found to be similar to two 500 mg tablets under fed conditions based on equivalent Cmaxand AUCs for the two formulations.Single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets from 500 mg to 2,500 mg resulted in less than proportional increase in both AUC and Cmax.Effect of food:Low-fat and high-fat meals increased the systemic exposure (as measured by AUC) from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets by about 38% and 73%, respectively, relative to fasting. Both meals prolonged metformin Tmax by approximately 3 hours but Cmaxwas not affected.DistributionThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of 850 mg metformin HCl averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.MetabolismIntravenous, single-dose studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans), nor biliary excretion.ExcretionRenal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.Special PopulationsRenal ImpairmentFollowing a single-dose administration of metformin hydrochloride extended -release tablets 500 mg in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment, the oral and renal clearance of metformin were decreased by 33% and 50% and 16% and 53%, respectively. Metformin peak and systemic exposure was 27% and 61% greater, respectively in subjects with mild renal impairment and 74% and 2.36\u00ad fold greater in subjects with moderate renal impairment as compared to healthy subjects.[seeDosage and Administration ( 2.2 ),Contraindications ( 4 ), andWarnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ).]Hepatic ImpairmentNo pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have been conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment,[seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )andUse in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]GeriatricsLimited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin HCl in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased by 35%, the half-life is prolonged by 64% and Cmax is increased by 76%, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function.[seeDosage and Administration ( 2 )andWarnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ).]GenderIn the pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers, there were no important differences between male and female subjects with respect to metformin AUC and t1/2. However, Cmax for metformin was 40% higher in female subjects as compared to males. In controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin HCl tablets was comparable in males and females. The gender differences for Cmax are unlikely to be clinically important.RaceA trend towards 10% higher metformin Cmaxand AUC values for metformin are obtained in Asian subjects when compared to Caucasian, Hispanic and Black subjects. The differences between the Asian and Caucasian groups are unlikely to be clinically important. In controlled clinical studies of metformin HCl in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in whites (n=249), blacks (n=51) and Hispanics (n=24).PediatricsThere are no available pharmacokinetic data with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in pediatric patients.Drug InteractionsSpecific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have not been performed except for one with glyburide.

Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorptionFollowing a single oral dose of 1,000 mg (2x500 mg tablets) metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets after a meal, the time to reach maximum plasma metformin concentration (Tmax) is achieved at approximately 7 to 8 hours. In both single- and multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects, once daily 1,000 mg (2x500 mg tablets) dosing provides equivalent systemic exposure, as measured by area under the curve (AUC), and up to 35% higher Cmax, of metformin relative to the immediate-release given as 500 mg twice daily. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL.In a two-way, single-dose, crossover study in healthy volunteers, the 1,000 mg tablet was found to be similar to two 500 mg tablets under fed conditions based on equivalent Cmaxand AUCs for the two formulations.Single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets from 500 mg to 2,500 mg resulted in less than proportional increase in both AUC and Cmax.Effect of food:Low-fat and high-fat meals increased the systemic exposure (as measured by AUC) from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets by about 38% and 73%, respectively, relative to fasting. Both meals prolonged metformin Tmax by approximately 3 hours but Cmaxwas not affected.DistributionThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of 850 mg metformin HCl averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.MetabolismIntravenous, single-dose studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans), nor biliary excretion.ExcretionRenal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.Special PopulationsRenal ImpairmentFollowing a single-dose administration of metformin hydrochloride extended -release tablets 500 mg in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment, the oral and renal clearance of metformin were decreased by 33% and 50% and 16% and 53%, respectively. Metformin peak and systemic exposure was 27% and 61% greater, respectively in subjects with mild renal impairment and 74% and 2.36\u00ad fold greater in subjects with moderate renal impairment as compared to healthy subjects.[seeDosage and Administration ( 2.2 ),Contraindications ( 4 ), andWarnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ).]Hepatic ImpairmentNo pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have been conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment,[seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )andUse in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]GeriatricsLimited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin HCl in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased by 35%, the half-life is prolonged by 64% and Cmax is increased by 76%, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function.[seeDosage and Administration ( 2 )andWarnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ).]GenderIn the pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers, there were no important differences between male and female subjects with respect to metformin AUC and t1/2. However, Cmax for metformin was 40% higher in female subjects as compared to males. In controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin HCl tablets was comparable in males and females. The gender differences for Cmax are unlikely to be clinically important.RaceA trend towards 10% higher metformin Cmaxand AUC values for metformin are obtained in Asian subjects when compared to Caucasian, Hispanic and Black subjects. The differences between the Asian and Caucasian groups are unlikely to be clinically important. In controlled clinical studies of metformin HCl in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in whites (n=249), blacks (n=51) and Hispanics (n=24).PediatricsThere are no available pharmacokinetic data with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in pediatric patients.Drug InteractionsSpecific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have not been performed except for one with glyburide.
