    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid ReactionsRare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of ramelteon tablets. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with ramelteon tablets should not be rechallenged with the drug.5.2  Need to Evaluate for Comorbid DiagnosesSince sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient.The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia, or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities, may be the result of an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or physical disorder and requires further evaluation of the patient. Exacerbation of insomnia and emergence of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities were seen with ramelteon tablets during the clinical development program.5.3 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral ChangesA variety of cognitive and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of hypnotics. In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression (including suicidal ideation and completed suicides) has been reported in association with the use of hypnotics.Hallucinations, as well as behavioral changes such as bizarre behavior, agitation and mania have been reported with ramelteon tablets use. Amnesia, anxiety and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may also occur unpredictably.Complex behaviors such as \"sleep-driving\" (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a hypnotic) and other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex), with amnesia for the event, have been reported in association with hypnotic use. The use of alcohol and other CNS depressants may increase the risk of such behaviors. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. Complex behaviors have been reported with the use of ramelteon tablets. Discontinuation of ramelteon tablets should be strongly considered for patients who report any complex sleep behavior.5.4 CNS EffectsPatients should avoid engaging in hazardous activities that require concentration (such as operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery) after taking ramelteon tablets.After taking ramelteon tablets, patients should confine their activities to those necessary to prepare for bed.Patients should be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with ramelteon tablets as alcohol and ramelteon tablets may have additive effects when used in conjunction.5.5 Reproductive EffectsRamelteon tablets have been associated with an effect on reproductive hormones in adults, e.g., decreased testosterone levels and increased prolactin levels. It is not known what effect chronic or even chronic intermittent use of ramelteon tablets may have on the reproductive axis in developing humans[see Clinical Trials (14.3)].5.6 Use in Patients with Concomitant IllnessRamelteon tablet has not been studied in subjects with severe sleep apnea and is not recommended for use in this population[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].Ramelteon tablets should not be used by patients with severe hepatic impairment[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].5.7 Laboratory TestsMonitoringNo standard monitoring is required.For patients presenting with unexplained amenorrhea, galactorrhea, decreased libido, or problems with fertility, assessment of prolactin levels and testosterone levels should be considered as appropriate.Interference with Laboratory TestsRamelteon tablet is not known to interfere with commonly used clinical laboratory tests. In addition,in vitrodata indicate that ramelteon does not cause false-positive results for benzodiazepines, opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, cannabinoids, or amphetamines in two standard urine drug screening methodsin vitro.\n5.1 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid ReactionsRare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of ramelteon tablets.

Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with ramelteon tablets should not be rechallenged with the drug.5.2  Need to Evaluate for Comorbid DiagnosesSince sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient.The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia, or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities, may be the result of an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or physical disorder and requires further evaluation of the patient. Exacerbation of insomnia and emergence of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities were seen with ramelteon tablets during the clinical development program.5.3 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral ChangesA variety of cognitive and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of hypnotics. In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression (including suicidal ideation and completed suicides) has been reported in association with the use of hypnotics.Hallucinations, as well as behavioral changes such as bizarre behavior, agitation and mania have been reported with ramelteon tablets use. Amnesia, anxiety and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may also occur unpredictably.Complex behaviors such as \"sleep-driving\" (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a hypnotic) and other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex), with amnesia for the event, have been reported in association with hypnotic use. The use of alcohol and other CNS depressants may increase the risk of such behaviors. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. Complex behaviors have been reported with the use of ramelteon tablets. Discontinuation of ramelteon tablets should be strongly considered for patients who report any complex sleep behavior.5.4 CNS EffectsPatients should avoid engaging in hazardous activities that require concentration (such as operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery) after taking ramelteon tablets.After taking ramelteon tablets, patients should confine their activities to those necessary to prepare for bed.Patients should be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with ramelteon tablets as alcohol and ramelteon tablets may have additive effects when used in conjunction.5.5 Reproductive EffectsRamelteon tablets have been associated with an effect on reproductive hormones in adults, e.g., decreased testosterone levels and increased prolactin levels. It is not known what effect chronic or even chronic intermittent use of ramelteon tablets may have on the reproductive axis in developing humans[see Clinical Trials (14.3)].5.6 Use in Patients with Concomitant IllnessRamelteon tablet has not been studied in subjects with severe sleep apnea and is not recommended for use in this population[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].Ramelteon tablets should not be used by patients with severe hepatic impairment[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].5.7 Laboratory TestsMonitoringNo standard monitoring is required.For patients presenting with unexplained amenorrhea, galactorrhea, decreased libido, or problems with fertility, assessment of prolactin levels and testosterone levels should be considered as appropriate.Interference with Laboratory TestsRamelteon tablet is not known to interfere with commonly used clinical laboratory tests. In addition,in vitrodata indicate that ramelteon does not cause false-positive results for benzodiazepines, opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, cannabinoids, or amphetamines in two standard urine drug screening methodsin vitro.\n5.1 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid ReactionsRare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of ramelteon tablets. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department.

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS": "The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections:Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]Abnormal thinking, behavior changes, and complex behaviors[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]CNS effects[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]6.1 Clinical Trials ExperienceAdverse Reactions Resulting in Discontinuation of TreatmentThe data described in this section reflect exposure to ramelteon tablets in 5373 subjects, including 722 exposed for six months or longer, and 448 subjects for one year.Six percent of the 5373 individual subjects exposed to ramelteon tablets in clinical studies discontinued treatment owing to an adverse event, compared with 2% of the 2279 subjects receiving placebo.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryAvailable data from postmarketing reports with ramelteon tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal studies, ramelteon produced evidence of developmental toxicity, including teratogenic effects, in rats at doses greater than 36 times the recommended human dose (RHD) of 8 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m2)(see Data).The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.DataAnimal DataOral administration of ramelteon (10, 40, 150 or 600 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis was associated with increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities (malformations and variations) at doses greater than 40 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose is approximately 50 times the RHD based on mg/m2. Treatment of pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced no evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity at oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (or up to 720 times the RHD based on mg/m2).When rats were orally administered ramelteon (30, 100, or 300 mg/kg/day) throughout gestation and lactation, growth retardation, developmental delay, and behavioral changes were observed in the offspring at doses greater than 30 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose is 36 times the RHD based on mg/m2. Increased incidences of malformation and death among offspring were seen at the highest dose.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data regarding the presence of ramelteon or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ramelteon and/or its metabolites are present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the mechanism of action of ramelteon, there is a potential risk for somnolence in a breastfed infant(see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ramelteon tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ramelteon tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.Clinical ConsiderationsInfants exposed to ramelteon through breastmilk should be monitored for somnolence and feeding problems. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 25 hours (approximately 5 elimination half-lives) after ramelteon tablets administration in order to minimize drug exposure to a breastfed infant.8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of ramelteon tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Further study is needed prior to determining that this product may be used safely in prepubescent and pubescent patients.8.5 Geriatric UseA total of 654 subjects in double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy trials who received ramelteon tablets were at least 65 years of age; of these, 199 were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly and younger adult subjects.A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in elderly subjects with insomnia (n=33) evaluated the effect of a single dose of ramelteon tablets on balance, mobility, and memory functions after middle of the night awakening. There is no information on the effect of multiple dosing. Night time dosing of ramelteon tablets 8 mg did not impair middle of the night balance, mobility, or memory functions relative to placebo. The effects on night balance in the elderly cannot be definitively known from this study.8.6  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary DiseaseThe respiratory depressant effect of ramelteon tablets was evaluated in a crossover design study of subjects (n=26) with mild to moderate COPD after administering a single 16 mg dose or placebo, and in a separate study (n=25), the effects of ramelteon tablets on respiratory parameters were evaluated after administering an 8 mg dose or placebo in a crossover design to patients with moderate to severe COPD, defined as patients who had forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity ratio of <70%, and a FEV1<80% of predicted with <12% reversibility to albuterol. Treatment with a single dose of ramelteon tablets has no demonstrable respiratory depressant effects in subjects with mild to severe COPD, as measured by arterial O2 saturation (SaO2). There is no available information on the respiratory effects of multiple doses of ramelteon tablets in patients with COPD. The respiratory depressant effects in patients with COPD cannot be definitively known from this study.8.7 Sleep ApneaThe effects of ramelteon tablets were evaluated after administering a 16 mg dose or placebo in a crossover design to subjects (n=26) with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. Treatment with ramelteon tablets 16 mg for one night showed no difference compared with placebo on the Apnea/Hypopnea Index (the primary outcome variable), apnea index, hypopnea index, central apnea index, mixed apnea index, and obstructive apnea index. Treatment with a single dose of ramelteon tablets does not exacerbate mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. There is no available information on the respiratory effects of multiple doses of ramelteon tablets in patients with sleep apnea. The effects on exacerbation in patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea cannot be definitively known from this study.Ramelteon tablets has not been studied in subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea; use of ramelteon tablets are not recommended in such patients.8.8 Hepatic ImpairmentExposure to ramelteon tablets were increased by four-fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and by more than ten-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Ramelteon tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].Ramelteon tablets are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.8.9 Renal ImpairmentNo effects on Cmaxand AUC0 to tof parent drug or M-II were seen. No adjustment of ramelteon tablets dosage is required in patients with renal impairment[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryAvailable data from postmarketing reports with ramelteon tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

Treatment of pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced no evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity at oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (or up to 720 times the RHD based on mg/m2).When rats were orally administered ramelteon (30, 100, or 300 mg/kg/day) throughout gestation and lactation, growth retardation, developmental delay, and behavioral changes were observed in the offspring at doses greater than 30 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose is 36 times the RHD based on mg/m2. Increased incidences of malformation and death among offspring were seen at the highest dose.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data regarding the presence of ramelteon or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ramelteon and/or its metabolites are present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the mechanism of action of ramelteon, there is a potential risk for somnolence in a breastfed infant(see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ramelteon tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ramelteon tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.Clinical ConsiderationsInfants exposed to ramelteon through breastmilk should be monitored for somnolence and feeding problems. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 25 hours (approximately 5 elimination half-lives) after ramelteon tablets administration in order to minimize drug exposure to a breastfed infant.8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of ramelteon tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Further study is needed prior to determining that this product may be used safely in prepubescent and pubescent patients.8.5 Geriatric UseA total of 654 subjects in double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy trials who received ramelteon tablets were at least 65 years of age; of these, 199 were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly and younger adult subjects.A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in elderly subjects with insomnia (n=33) evaluated the effect of a single dose of ramelteon tablets on balance, mobility, and memory functions after middle of the night awakening. There is no information on the effect of multiple dosing. Night time dosing of ramelteon tablets 8 mg did not impair middle of the night balance, mobility, or memory functions relative to placebo. The effects on night balance in the elderly cannot be definitively known from this study.8.6  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary DiseaseThe respiratory depressant effect of ramelteon tablets was evaluated in a crossover design study of subjects (n=26) with mild to moderate COPD after administering a single 16 mg dose or placebo, and in a separate study (n=25), the effects of ramelteon tablets on respiratory parameters were evaluated after administering an 8 mg dose or placebo in a crossover design to patients with moderate to severe COPD, defined as patients who had forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity ratio of <70%, and a FEV1<80% of predicted with <12% reversibility to albuterol. Treatment with a single dose of ramelteon tablets has no demonstrable respiratory depressant effects in subjects with mild to severe COPD, as measured by arterial O2 saturation (SaO2). There is no available information on the respiratory effects of multiple doses of ramelteon tablets in patients with COPD. The respiratory depressant effects in patients with COPD cannot be definitively known from this study.8.7 Sleep ApneaThe effects of ramelteon tablets were evaluated after administering a 16 mg dose or placebo in a crossover design to subjects (n=26) with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. Treatment with ramelteon tablets 16 mg for one night showed no difference compared with placebo on the Apnea/Hypopnea Index (the primary outcome variable), apnea index, hypopnea index, central apnea index, mixed apnea index, and obstructive apnea index. Treatment with a single dose of ramelteon tablets does not exacerbate mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. There is no available information on the respiratory effects of multiple doses of ramelteon tablets in patients with sleep apnea. The effects on exacerbation in patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea cannot be definitively known from this study.Ramelteon tablets has not been studied in subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea; use of ramelteon tablets are not recommended in such patients.8.8 Hepatic ImpairmentExposure to ramelteon tablets were increased by four-fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and by more than ten-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Ramelteon tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].Ramelteon tablets are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.8.9 Renal ImpairmentNo effects on Cmaxand AUC0 to tof parent drug or M-II were seen. No adjustment of ramelteon tablets dosage is required in patients with renal impairment[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryAvailable data from postmarketing reports with ramelteon tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal studies, ramelteon produced evidence of developmental toxicity, including teratogenic effects, in rats at doses greater than 36 times the recommended human dose (RHD) of 8 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m2)(see Data).The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.DataAnimal DataOral administration of ramelteon (10, 40, 150 or 600 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis was associated with increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities (malformations and variations) at doses greater than 40 mg/kg/day.

The effects on night balance in the elderly cannot be definitively known from this study.8.6  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary DiseaseThe respiratory depressant effect of ramelteon tablets was evaluated in a crossover design study of subjects (n=26) with mild to moderate COPD after administering a single 16 mg dose or placebo, and in a separate study (n=25), the effects of ramelteon tablets on respiratory parameters were evaluated after administering an 8 mg dose or placebo in a crossover design to patients with moderate to severe COPD, defined as patients who had forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity ratio of <70%, and a FEV1<80% of predicted with <12% reversibility to albuterol. Treatment with a single dose of ramelteon tablets has no demonstrable respiratory depressant effects in subjects with mild to severe COPD, as measured by arterial O2 saturation (SaO2). There is no available information on the respiratory effects of multiple doses of ramelteon tablets in patients with COPD. The respiratory depressant effects in patients with COPD cannot be definitively known from this study.8.7 Sleep ApneaThe effects of ramelteon tablets were evaluated after administering a 16 mg dose or placebo in a crossover design to subjects (n=26) with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. Treatment with ramelteon tablets 16 mg for one night showed no difference compared with placebo on the Apnea/Hypopnea Index (the primary outcome variable), apnea index, hypopnea index, central apnea index, mixed apnea index, and obstructive apnea index. Treatment with a single dose of ramelteon tablets does not exacerbate mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. There is no available information on the respiratory effects of multiple doses of ramelteon tablets in patients with sleep apnea. The effects on exacerbation in patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea cannot be definitively known from this study.Ramelteon tablets has not been studied in subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea; use of ramelteon tablets are not recommended in such patients.8.8 Hepatic ImpairmentExposure to ramelteon tablets were increased by four-fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and by more than ten-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Ramelteon tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].Ramelteon tablets are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.8.9 Renal ImpairmentNo effects on Cmaxand AUC0 to tof parent drug or M-II were seen. No adjustment of ramelteon tablets dosage is required in patients with renal impairment[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryAvailable data from postmarketing reports with ramelteon tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal studies, ramelteon produced evidence of developmental toxicity, including teratogenic effects, in rats at doses greater than 36 times the recommended human dose (RHD) of 8 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m2)(see Data).The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.DataAnimal DataOral administration of ramelteon (10, 40, 150 or 600 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis was associated with increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities (malformations and variations) at doses greater than 40 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose is approximately 50 times the RHD based on mg/m2. Treatment of pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced no evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity at oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (or up to 720 times the RHD based on mg/m2).When rats were orally administered ramelteon (30, 100, or 300 mg/kg/day) throughout gestation and lactation, growth retardation, developmental delay, and behavioral changes were observed in the offspring at doses greater than 30 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose is 36 times the RHD based on mg/m2. Increased incidences of malformation and death among offspring were seen at the highest dose.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data regarding the presence of ramelteon or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ramelteon and/or its metabolites are present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the mechanism of action of ramelteon, there is a potential risk for somnolence in a breastfed infant(see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ramelteon tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ramelteon tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.Clinical ConsiderationsInfants exposed to ramelteon through breastmilk should be monitored for somnolence and feeding problems. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 25 hours (approximately 5 elimination half-lives) after ramelteon tablets administration in order to minimize drug exposure to a breastfed infant.8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of ramelteon tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Further study is needed prior to determining that this product may be used safely in prepubescent and pubescent patients.8.5 Geriatric UseA total of 654 subjects in double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy trials who received ramelteon tablets were at least 65 years of age; of these, 199 were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly and younger adult subjects.A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in elderly subjects with insomnia (n=33) evaluated the effect of a single dose of ramelteon tablets on balance, mobility, and memory functions after middle of the night awakening.

    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "12.1 Mechanism of ActionRamelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT1and MT2receptors and relative selectivity over the MT3receptor.The activity of ramelteon at the MT1and MT2receptors is believed to contribute to its sleep-promoting properties, as these receptors, acted upon by endogenous melatonin, are thought to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep-wake cycle.Ramelteon has no appreciable affinity for the GABA receptor complex or for receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and opiates. \u00a0Ramelteon also does not interfere with the activity of a number of selected enzymes in a standard panel.The major metabolite of ramelteon, M-II, is pharmacologically active and has approximately one tenth and one fifth the binding affinity of the parent molecule for the human MT1and MT2receptors, respectively. However, M-II circulates at higher concentrations than the parent producing 20- to 100-fold greater mean systemic exposure when compared to ramelteon. Similar to ramelteon, M-II does not interfere with the activity of a number of endogenous enzymes.All other known metabolites of ramelteon are inactive.12.3 PharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetic profile of ramelteon tablets has been evaluated in healthy subjects as well as in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment. When administered orally to humans in doses ranging from 4 to 64 mg, ramelteon undergoes rapid, high first-pass metabolism, and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. Maximal serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) data show substantial intersubject variability, consistent with the high first-pass effect; the coefficient of variation for these values is approximately 100%. Several metabolites have been identified in human serum and urine.AbsorptionRamelteon is absorbed rapidly, with median peak concentrations occurring at approximately 0.75 hour (range, 0.5 to 1.5 hours) after fasted oral administration. Although the total absorption of ramelteon is at least 84%, the absolute oral bioavailability is only 1.8% due to extensive first-pass metabolism.DistributionIn vitroprotein binding of ramelteon is approximately 82% in human serum, independent of concentration. Binding to albumin accounts for most of that binding, since 70% of the drug is bound in human serum albumin. Ramelteon is not distributed selectively to red blood cells. Ramelteon has a mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of 73.6 L, suggesting substantial tissue distribution.MetabolismMetabolism of ramelteon consists primarily of oxidation to hydroxyl and carbonyl derivatives, with secondary metabolism producing glucuronide conjugates. CYP1A2 is the major isozyme involved in the hepatic metabolism of ramelteon; the CYP2C subfamily and CYP3A4 isozymes are also involved to a minor degree.The rank order of the principal metabolites by prevalence in human serum is M-II, M-IV, M-I, and M-III. These metabolites are formed rapidly and exhibit a monophasic decline and rapid elimination. The overall mean systemic exposure of M-II is approximately 20- to 100-fold higher than parent drug.EliminationFollowing oral administration of radiolabeled ramelteon, 84% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 4% in feces, resulting in a mean recovery of 88%. Less than 0.1% of the dose was excreted in urine and feces as the parent compound. Elimination was essentially complete by 96 hours postdose.Repeated once daily dosing with ramelteon tablets does not result in significant accumulation owing to the short elimination half-life of ramelteon (on average, approximately one to 2.6 hours).The half-life of M-II is two to five hours and independent of dose. Serum concentrations of the parent drug and its metabolites in humans are at or below the lower limits of quantitation within 24 hours.Effect of FoodWhen administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC0-inffor a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablet was 31% higher and the Cmaxwas 22% lower than when given in a fasted state. Median Tmaxwas delayed by approximately 45 minutes when ramelteon tablets were administered with food. Effects of food on the AUC values for M-II were similar. It is therefore recommended that ramelteon tablets not be taken with or immediately after a high-fat meal[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].12.4 Pharmacokinetics in Special PopulationsAgeIn a group of 24 elderly subjects aged 63 to 79 years administered a single ramelteon tablets 16 mg dose, the mean Cmaxand AUC0 to infvalues were 11.6 ng/mL (SD, 13.8) and 18.7 ng\u2022hr/mL (SD, 19.4), respectively. The elimination half-life was 2.6 hours (SD, 1.1). Compared with younger adults, the total exposure (AUC0 to inf) and Cmaxof ramelteon were 97 and 86% higher, respectively, in elderly subjects. The AUC0-infand Cmaxof M-II were increased by 30 and 13%, respectively, in elderly subjects.GenderThere are no clinically meaningful gender-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of ramelteon tablets or its metabolites.Hepatic ImpairmentExposure to ramelteon tablets was increased almost four-fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment after seven days of dosing with 16 mg/day; exposure was further increased (more than ten-fold) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Exposure to M-II was only marginally increased in mildly and moderately impaired subjects relative to healthy matched controls. The pharmacokinetics of ramelteon tablets have not been evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Ramelteon tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].Renal ImpairmentThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of ramelteon tablets were studied after administering a 16 mg dose to subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment based on predose creatinine clearance (53 to 95, 35 to 49, or 15 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively), and in subjects who required chronic hemodialysis. Wide intersubject variability was seen in ramelteon tablets exposure parameters. However, no effects on Cmaxor AUC0-tof parent drug or M-II were seen in any of the treatment groups; the incidence of adverse events was similar across groups. These results are consistent with the negligible renal clearance of ramelteon, which is principally eliminated via hepatic metabolism. No adjustment of ramelteon tablets dosage are required in patients with renal impairment, including patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of \u226430 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients who require chronic hemodialysis.12.5 Drug-Drug InteractionsRamelteon tablets have a highly variable intersubject pharmacokinetic profile (approximately 100% coefficient of variation in Cmaxand AUC). As noted above, CYP1A2 is the major isozyme involved in the metabolism of ramelteon tablets; the CYP2C subfamily and CYP3A4 isozymes are also involved to a minor degree.Effects of Other Drugs on Ramelteon Tablets MetabolismFluvoxamine (strong CYP1A2 inhibitor)When fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily was administered for three days prior to single-dose coadministration of ramelteon tablets 16 mg and fluvoxamine, the AUC0 to inffor ramelteon increased approximately 190-fold, and the Cmaxincreased approximately 70-fold, compared to ramelteon tablets administered alone. Ramelteon tablets should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine. Other less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors have not been adequately studied. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution to patients taking less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors[see Contraindications (4),Drug Interactions (7)].Rifampin (strong CYP enzyme inducer)Administration of rifampin 600 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in a mean decrease of approximately 80% (40 to 90%) in total exposure to ramelteon and metabolite M-II, (both AUC0-infand Cmax) after a single 32 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. Efficacy may be reduced when ramelteon tablets are used in combination with strong CYP enzyme inducers such as rifampin[see Drug Interactions (7)].Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor)The AUC0 to infand Cmaxof ramelteon increased by approximately 84% and 36%, respectively, when a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets were administered on the fourth day of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily administration, compared to administration of ramelteon tablet alone. Similar increases were seen in M-II pharmacokinetic variables. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole[see Drug Interactions (7)].Fluconazole (strong CYP2C9 inhibitor)The total and peak systemic exposure (AUC0-infand Cmax) of ramelteon after a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets was increased by approximately 150% when administered with fluconazole. Similar increases were also seen in M-II exposure. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole[see Drug Interactions (7)].DonepezilAdministration of donepezil 10 mg once daily for 26 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 100% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 87% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with donepezil[see Drug Interactions (7)].DoxepinAdministration of doxepin 10 mg once daily for 23 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 66% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 69% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with doxepin[see Drug Interactions (7)].Interaction studies of concomitant administration of ramelteon tablets with fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), omeprazole (CYP1A2 inducer/CYP2C19 inhibitor), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), sertraline, venlafaxine, escitalopram, gabapentin, and zolpidem did not produce clinically meaningful changes in either peak or total exposures to ramelteon or the M-II metabolite.Effects of Ramelteon Tablets on Metabolism of Other DrugsZolpidemAdministration of ramelteon 8 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in an increase in median Tmaxof zolpidem by approximately 20 minutes and exposure to zolpidem (both AUC0-infand Cmax) was unchanged after a single 10 mg dose of zolpidem. Ordinarily zolpidem should not be given in a patient taking ramelteon tablets.Concomitant administration of ramelteon tablets with omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), digoxin (p-glycoprotein substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 [S]/CYP1A2 [R] substrate), venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, donepezil, doxepin, sertraline, escitalopram, and gabapentin did not produce clinically meaningful changes in peak and total exposures to these drugs.Effect of Alcohol on Ramelteon TabletsWith single-dose, daytime coadministration of ramelteon tablets 32 mg and alcohol (0.6 g/kg), there were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant effects on peak or total exposure to ramelteon tablets. However, an additive effect was seen on some measures of psychomotor performance (i.e., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task Test, and a Visual Analog Scale of Sedation) at some postdose time points. No additive effect was seen on the Delayed Word Recognition Test. Because alcohol by itself impairs performance, and the intended effect of ramelteon tablets is to promote sleep, patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ramelteon tablets.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionRamelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT1and MT2receptors and relative selectivity over the MT3receptor.The activity of ramelteon at the MT1and MT2receptors is believed to contribute to its sleep-promoting properties, as these receptors, acted upon by endogenous melatonin, are thought to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep-wake cycle.Ramelteon has no appreciable affinity for the GABA receptor complex or for receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and opiates. \u00a0Ramelteon also does not interfere with the activity of a number of selected enzymes in a standard panel.The major metabolite of ramelteon, M-II, is pharmacologically active and has approximately one tenth and one fifth the binding affinity of the parent molecule for the human MT1and MT2receptors, respectively.

Several metabolites have been identified in human serum and urine.AbsorptionRamelteon is absorbed rapidly, with median peak concentrations occurring at approximately 0.75 hour (range, 0.5 to 1.5 hours) after fasted oral administration. Although the total absorption of ramelteon is at least 84%, the absolute oral bioavailability is only 1.8% due to extensive first-pass metabolism.DistributionIn vitroprotein binding of ramelteon is approximately 82% in human serum, independent of concentration. Binding to albumin accounts for most of that binding, since 70% of the drug is bound in human serum albumin. Ramelteon is not distributed selectively to red blood cells. Ramelteon has a mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of 73.6 L, suggesting substantial tissue distribution.MetabolismMetabolism of ramelteon consists primarily of oxidation to hydroxyl and carbonyl derivatives, with secondary metabolism producing glucuronide conjugates. CYP1A2 is the major isozyme involved in the hepatic metabolism of ramelteon; the CYP2C subfamily and CYP3A4 isozymes are also involved to a minor degree.The rank order of the principal metabolites by prevalence in human serum is M-II, M-IV, M-I, and M-III. These metabolites are formed rapidly and exhibit a monophasic decline and rapid elimination. The overall mean systemic exposure of M-II is approximately 20- to 100-fold higher than parent drug.EliminationFollowing oral administration of radiolabeled ramelteon, 84% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 4% in feces, resulting in a mean recovery of 88%. Less than 0.1% of the dose was excreted in urine and feces as the parent compound. Elimination was essentially complete by 96 hours postdose.Repeated once daily dosing with ramelteon tablets does not result in significant accumulation owing to the short elimination half-life of ramelteon (on average, approximately one to 2.6 hours).The half-life of M-II is two to five hours and independent of dose. Serum concentrations of the parent drug and its metabolites in humans are at or below the lower limits of quantitation within 24 hours.Effect of FoodWhen administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC0-inffor a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablet was 31% higher and the Cmaxwas 22% lower than when given in a fasted state. Median Tmaxwas delayed by approximately 45 minutes when ramelteon tablets were administered with food. Effects of food on the AUC values for M-II were similar. It is therefore recommended that ramelteon tablets not be taken with or immediately after a high-fat meal[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].12.4 Pharmacokinetics in Special PopulationsAgeIn a group of 24 elderly subjects aged 63 to 79 years administered a single ramelteon tablets 16 mg dose, the mean Cmaxand AUC0 to infvalues were 11.6 ng/mL (SD, 13.8) and 18.7 ng\u2022hr/mL (SD, 19.4), respectively. The elimination half-life was 2.6 hours (SD, 1.1). Compared with younger adults, the total exposure (AUC0 to inf) and Cmaxof ramelteon were 97 and 86% higher, respectively, in elderly subjects. The AUC0-infand Cmaxof M-II were increased by 30 and 13%, respectively, in elderly subjects.GenderThere are no clinically meaningful gender-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of ramelteon tablets or its metabolites.Hepatic ImpairmentExposure to ramelteon tablets was increased almost four-fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment after seven days of dosing with 16 mg/day; exposure was further increased (more than ten-fold) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Exposure to M-II was only marginally increased in mildly and moderately impaired subjects relative to healthy matched controls. The pharmacokinetics of ramelteon tablets have not been evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Ramelteon tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].Renal ImpairmentThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of ramelteon tablets were studied after administering a 16 mg dose to subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment based on predose creatinine clearance (53 to 95, 35 to 49, or 15 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively), and in subjects who required chronic hemodialysis. Wide intersubject variability was seen in ramelteon tablets exposure parameters. However, no effects on Cmaxor AUC0-tof parent drug or M-II were seen in any of the treatment groups; the incidence of adverse events was similar across groups. These results are consistent with the negligible renal clearance of ramelteon, which is principally eliminated via hepatic metabolism. No adjustment of ramelteon tablets dosage are required in patients with renal impairment, including patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of \u226430 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients who require chronic hemodialysis.12.5 Drug-Drug InteractionsRamelteon tablets have a highly variable intersubject pharmacokinetic profile (approximately 100% coefficient of variation in Cmaxand AUC). As noted above, CYP1A2 is the major isozyme involved in the metabolism of ramelteon tablets; the CYP2C subfamily and CYP3A4 isozymes are also involved to a minor degree.Effects of Other Drugs on Ramelteon Tablets MetabolismFluvoxamine (strong CYP1A2 inhibitor)When fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily was administered for three days prior to single-dose coadministration of ramelteon tablets 16 mg and fluvoxamine, the AUC0 to inffor ramelteon increased approximately 190-fold, and the Cmaxincreased approximately 70-fold, compared to ramelteon tablets administered alone. Ramelteon tablets should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine. Other less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors have not been adequately studied. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution to patients taking less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors[see Contraindications (4),Drug Interactions (7)].Rifampin (strong CYP enzyme inducer)Administration of rifampin 600 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in a mean decrease of approximately 80% (40 to 90%) in total exposure to ramelteon and metabolite M-II, (both AUC0-infand Cmax) after a single 32 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. Efficacy may be reduced when ramelteon tablets are used in combination with strong CYP enzyme inducers such as rifampin[see Drug Interactions (7)].Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor)The AUC0 to infand Cmaxof ramelteon increased by approximately 84% and 36%, respectively, when a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets were administered on the fourth day of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily administration, compared to administration of ramelteon tablet alone. Similar increases were seen in M-II pharmacokinetic variables. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole[see Drug Interactions (7)].Fluconazole (strong CYP2C9 inhibitor)The total and peak systemic exposure (AUC0-infand Cmax) of ramelteon after a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets was increased by approximately 150% when administered with fluconazole. Similar increases were also seen in M-II exposure. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole[see Drug Interactions (7)].DonepezilAdministration of donepezil 10 mg once daily for 26 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 100% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 87% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with donepezil[see Drug Interactions (7)].DoxepinAdministration of doxepin 10 mg once daily for 23 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 66% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 69% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with doxepin[see Drug Interactions (7)].Interaction studies of concomitant administration of ramelteon tablets with fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), omeprazole (CYP1A2 inducer/CYP2C19 inhibitor), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), sertraline, venlafaxine, escitalopram, gabapentin, and zolpidem did not produce clinically meaningful changes in either peak or total exposures to ramelteon or the M-II metabolite.Effects of Ramelteon Tablets on Metabolism of Other DrugsZolpidemAdministration of ramelteon 8 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in an increase in median Tmaxof zolpidem by approximately 20 minutes and exposure to zolpidem (both AUC0-infand Cmax) was unchanged after a single 10 mg dose of zolpidem. Ordinarily zolpidem should not be given in a patient taking ramelteon tablets.Concomitant administration of ramelteon tablets with omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), digoxin (p-glycoprotein substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 [S]/CYP1A2 [R] substrate), venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, donepezil, doxepin, sertraline, escitalopram, and gabapentin did not produce clinically meaningful changes in peak and total exposures to these drugs.Effect of Alcohol on Ramelteon TabletsWith single-dose, daytime coadministration of ramelteon tablets 32 mg and alcohol (0.6 g/kg), there were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant effects on peak or total exposure to ramelteon tablets. However, an additive effect was seen on some measures of psychomotor performance (i.e., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task Test, and a Visual Analog Scale of Sedation) at some postdose time points. No additive effect was seen on the Delayed Word Recognition Test. Because alcohol by itself impairs performance, and the intended effect of ramelteon tablets is to promote sleep, patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ramelteon tablets.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionRamelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT1and MT2receptors and relative selectivity over the MT3receptor.The activity of ramelteon at the MT1and MT2receptors is believed to contribute to its sleep-promoting properties, as these receptors, acted upon by endogenous melatonin, are thought to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep-wake cycle.Ramelteon has no appreciable affinity for the GABA receptor complex or for receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and opiates. \u00a0Ramelteon also does not interfere with the activity of a number of selected enzymes in a standard panel.The major metabolite of ramelteon, M-II, is pharmacologically active and has approximately one tenth and one fifth the binding affinity of the parent molecule for the human MT1and MT2receptors, respectively. However, M-II circulates at higher concentrations than the parent producing 20- to 100-fold greater mean systemic exposure when compared to ramelteon. Similar to ramelteon, M-II does not interfere with the activity of a number of endogenous enzymes.All other known metabolites of ramelteon are inactive.12.3 PharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetic profile of ramelteon tablets has been evaluated in healthy subjects as well as in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment.

Ordinarily zolpidem should not be given in a patient taking ramelteon tablets.Concomitant administration of ramelteon tablets with omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), digoxin (p-glycoprotein substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 [S]/CYP1A2 [R] substrate), venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, donepezil, doxepin, sertraline, escitalopram, and gabapentin did not produce clinically meaningful changes in peak and total exposures to these drugs.Effect of Alcohol on Ramelteon TabletsWith single-dose, daytime coadministration of ramelteon tablets 32 mg and alcohol (0.6 g/kg), there were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant effects on peak or total exposure to ramelteon tablets. However, an additive effect was seen on some measures of psychomotor performance (i.e., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task Test, and a Visual Analog Scale of Sedation) at some postdose time points. No additive effect was seen on the Delayed Word Recognition Test. Because alcohol by itself impairs performance, and the intended effect of ramelteon tablets is to promote sleep, patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ramelteon tablets.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionRamelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT1and MT2receptors and relative selectivity over the MT3receptor.The activity of ramelteon at the MT1and MT2receptors is believed to contribute to its sleep-promoting properties, as these receptors, acted upon by endogenous melatonin, are thought to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep-wake cycle.Ramelteon has no appreciable affinity for the GABA receptor complex or for receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and opiates. \u00a0Ramelteon also does not interfere with the activity of a number of selected enzymes in a standard panel.The major metabolite of ramelteon, M-II, is pharmacologically active and has approximately one tenth and one fifth the binding affinity of the parent molecule for the human MT1and MT2receptors, respectively. However, M-II circulates at higher concentrations than the parent producing 20- to 100-fold greater mean systemic exposure when compared to ramelteon. Similar to ramelteon, M-II does not interfere with the activity of a number of endogenous enzymes.All other known metabolites of ramelteon are inactive.12.3 PharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetic profile of ramelteon tablets has been evaluated in healthy subjects as well as in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment. When administered orally to humans in doses ranging from 4 to 64 mg, ramelteon undergoes rapid, high first-pass metabolism, and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. Maximal serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) data show substantial intersubject variability, consistent with the high first-pass effect; the coefficient of variation for these values is approximately 100%. Several metabolites have been identified in human serum and urine.AbsorptionRamelteon is absorbed rapidly, with median peak concentrations occurring at approximately 0.75 hour (range, 0.5 to 1.5 hours) after fasted oral administration. Although the total absorption of ramelteon is at least 84%, the absolute oral bioavailability is only 1.8% due to extensive first-pass metabolism.DistributionIn vitroprotein binding of ramelteon is approximately 82% in human serum, independent of concentration. Binding to albumin accounts for most of that binding, since 70% of the drug is bound in human serum albumin. Ramelteon is not distributed selectively to red blood cells. Ramelteon has a mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of 73.6 L, suggesting substantial tissue distribution.MetabolismMetabolism of ramelteon consists primarily of oxidation to hydroxyl and carbonyl derivatives, with secondary metabolism producing glucuronide conjugates. CYP1A2 is the major isozyme involved in the hepatic metabolism of ramelteon; the CYP2C subfamily and CYP3A4 isozymes are also involved to a minor degree.The rank order of the principal metabolites by prevalence in human serum is M-II, M-IV, M-I, and M-III. These metabolites are formed rapidly and exhibit a monophasic decline and rapid elimination. The overall mean systemic exposure of M-II is approximately 20- to 100-fold higher than parent drug.EliminationFollowing oral administration of radiolabeled ramelteon, 84% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 4% in feces, resulting in a mean recovery of 88%. Less than 0.1% of the dose was excreted in urine and feces as the parent compound. Elimination was essentially complete by 96 hours postdose.Repeated once daily dosing with ramelteon tablets does not result in significant accumulation owing to the short elimination half-life of ramelteon (on average, approximately one to 2.6 hours).The half-life of M-II is two to five hours and independent of dose. Serum concentrations of the parent drug and its metabolites in humans are at or below the lower limits of quantitation within 24 hours.Effect of FoodWhen administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC0-inffor a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablet was 31% higher and the Cmaxwas 22% lower than when given in a fasted state. Median Tmaxwas delayed by approximately 45 minutes when ramelteon tablets were administered with food. Effects of food on the AUC values for M-II were similar. It is therefore recommended that ramelteon tablets not be taken with or immediately after a high-fat meal[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].12.4 Pharmacokinetics in Special PopulationsAgeIn a group of 24 elderly subjects aged 63 to 79 years administered a single ramelteon tablets 16 mg dose, the mean Cmaxand AUC0 to infvalues were 11.6 ng/mL (SD, 13.8) and 18.7 ng\u2022hr/mL (SD, 19.4), respectively. The elimination half-life was 2.6 hours (SD, 1.1). Compared with younger adults, the total exposure (AUC0 to inf) and Cmaxof ramelteon were 97 and 86% higher, respectively, in elderly subjects. The AUC0-infand Cmaxof M-II were increased by 30 and 13%, respectively, in elderly subjects.GenderThere are no clinically meaningful gender-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of ramelteon tablets or its metabolites.Hepatic ImpairmentExposure to ramelteon tablets was increased almost four-fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment after seven days of dosing with 16 mg/day; exposure was further increased (more than ten-fold) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Exposure to M-II was only marginally increased in mildly and moderately impaired subjects relative to healthy matched controls. The pharmacokinetics of ramelteon tablets have not been evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Ramelteon tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].Renal ImpairmentThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of ramelteon tablets were studied after administering a 16 mg dose to subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment based on predose creatinine clearance (53 to 95, 35 to 49, or 15 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively), and in subjects who required chronic hemodialysis. Wide intersubject variability was seen in ramelteon tablets exposure parameters. However, no effects on Cmaxor AUC0-tof parent drug or M-II were seen in any of the treatment groups; the incidence of adverse events was similar across groups. These results are consistent with the negligible renal clearance of ramelteon, which is principally eliminated via hepatic metabolism. No adjustment of ramelteon tablets dosage are required in patients with renal impairment, including patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of \u226430 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients who require chronic hemodialysis.12.5 Drug-Drug InteractionsRamelteon tablets have a highly variable intersubject pharmacokinetic profile (approximately 100% coefficient of variation in Cmaxand AUC). As noted above, CYP1A2 is the major isozyme involved in the metabolism of ramelteon tablets; the CYP2C subfamily and CYP3A4 isozymes are also involved to a minor degree.Effects of Other Drugs on Ramelteon Tablets MetabolismFluvoxamine (strong CYP1A2 inhibitor)When fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily was administered for three days prior to single-dose coadministration of ramelteon tablets 16 mg and fluvoxamine, the AUC0 to inffor ramelteon increased approximately 190-fold, and the Cmaxincreased approximately 70-fold, compared to ramelteon tablets administered alone. Ramelteon tablets should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine. Other less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors have not been adequately studied. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution to patients taking less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors[see Contraindications (4),Drug Interactions (7)].Rifampin (strong CYP enzyme inducer)Administration of rifampin 600 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in a mean decrease of approximately 80% (40 to 90%) in total exposure to ramelteon and metabolite M-II, (both AUC0-infand Cmax) after a single 32 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. Efficacy may be reduced when ramelteon tablets are used in combination with strong CYP enzyme inducers such as rifampin[see Drug Interactions (7)].Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor)The AUC0 to infand Cmaxof ramelteon increased by approximately 84% and 36%, respectively, when a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets were administered on the fourth day of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily administration, compared to administration of ramelteon tablet alone. Similar increases were seen in M-II pharmacokinetic variables. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole[see Drug Interactions (7)].Fluconazole (strong CYP2C9 inhibitor)The total and peak systemic exposure (AUC0-infand Cmax) of ramelteon after a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets was increased by approximately 150% when administered with fluconazole. Similar increases were also seen in M-II exposure. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole[see Drug Interactions (7)].DonepezilAdministration of donepezil 10 mg once daily for 26 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 100% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 87% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with donepezil[see Drug Interactions (7)].DoxepinAdministration of doxepin 10 mg once daily for 23 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 66% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 69% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with doxepin[see Drug Interactions (7)].Interaction studies of concomitant administration of ramelteon tablets with fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), omeprazole (CYP1A2 inducer/CYP2C19 inhibitor), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), sertraline, venlafaxine, escitalopram, gabapentin, and zolpidem did not produce clinically meaningful changes in either peak or total exposures to ramelteon or the M-II metabolite.Effects of Ramelteon Tablets on Metabolism of Other DrugsZolpidemAdministration of ramelteon 8 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in an increase in median Tmaxof zolpidem by approximately 20 minutes and exposure to zolpidem (both AUC0-infand Cmax) was unchanged after a single 10 mg dose of zolpidem.

However, an additive effect was seen on some measures of psychomotor performance (i.e., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task Test, and a Visual Analog Scale of Sedation) at some postdose time points.

Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution to patients taking less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors[see Contraindications (4),Drug Interactions (7)].Rifampin (strong CYP enzyme inducer)Administration of rifampin 600 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in a mean decrease of approximately 80% (40 to 90%) in total exposure to ramelteon and metabolite M-II, (both AUC0-infand Cmax) after a single 32 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. Efficacy may be reduced when ramelteon tablets are used in combination with strong CYP enzyme inducers such as rifampin[see Drug Interactions (7)].Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor)The AUC0 to infand Cmaxof ramelteon increased by approximately 84% and 36%, respectively, when a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets were administered on the fourth day of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily administration, compared to administration of ramelteon tablet alone. Similar increases were seen in M-II pharmacokinetic variables. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole[see Drug Interactions (7)].Fluconazole (strong CYP2C9 inhibitor)The total and peak systemic exposure (AUC0-infand Cmax) of ramelteon after a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets was increased by approximately 150% when administered with fluconazole. Similar increases were also seen in M-II exposure. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole[see Drug Interactions (7)].DonepezilAdministration of donepezil 10 mg once daily for 26 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 100% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 87% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with donepezil[see Drug Interactions (7)].DoxepinAdministration of doxepin 10 mg once daily for 23 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 66% in overall exposure to ramelteon, (AUC0-inf) and a mean increase of approximately 69% in maximum exposure to ramelteon (Cmax) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets. No change was seen in M-II exposure. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with doxepin[see Drug Interactions (7)].Interaction studies of concomitant administration of ramelteon tablets with fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), omeprazole (CYP1A2 inducer/CYP2C19 inhibitor), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), sertraline, venlafaxine, escitalopram, gabapentin, and zolpidem did not produce clinically meaningful changes in either peak or total exposures to ramelteon or the M-II metabolite.Effects of Ramelteon Tablets on Metabolism of Other DrugsZolpidemAdministration of ramelteon 8 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in an increase in median Tmaxof zolpidem by approximately 20 minutes and exposure to zolpidem (both AUC0-infand Cmax) was unchanged after a single 10 mg dose of zolpidem. Ordinarily zolpidem should not be given in a patient taking ramelteon tablets.Concomitant administration of ramelteon tablets with omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), digoxin (p-glycoprotein substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 [S]/CYP1A2 [R] substrate), venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, donepezil, doxepin, sertraline, escitalopram, and gabapentin did not produce clinically meaningful changes in peak and total exposures to these drugs.Effect of Alcohol on Ramelteon TabletsWith single-dose, daytime coadministration of ramelteon tablets 32 mg and alcohol (0.6 g/kg), there were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant effects on peak or total exposure to ramelteon tablets. However, an additive effect was seen on some measures of psychomotor performance (i.e., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task Test, and a Visual Analog Scale of Sedation) at some postdose time points. No additive effect was seen on the Delayed Word Recognition Test. Because alcohol by itself impairs performance, and the intended effect of ramelteon tablets is to promote sleep, patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ramelteon tablets.",

    "14 CLINICAL STUDIES": "14.1 Controlled Clinical TrialsChronic InsomniaThree randomized, double-blind trials in subjects with chronic insomnia employing polysomnography (PSG) were provided as objective support of ramelteon tablet\u2019s effectiveness in sleep initiation.One study enrolled younger adults (aged 18 to 64 years, inclusive) with chronic insomnia and employed a parallel design in which the subjects received a single, nightly dose of ramelteon tablet (8 or 16 mg) or matching placebo for 35 days. PSG was performed on the first two nights in each of Weeks 1, 3, and 5 of treatment. Ramelteon tablets reduced the average latency to persistent sleep at each of the time points when compared to placebo. The 16 mg dose conferred no additional benefit for sleep initiation.The second study employing PSG was a three-period crossover trial performed in subjects aged 65 years and older with a history of chronic insomnia. Subjects received ramelteon tablets (4 or 8 mg) or placebo and underwent PSG assessment in a sleep laboratory for two consecutive nights in each of the three study periods. Both doses of ramelteon tablets reduced latency to persistent sleep when compared to placebo.The third study evaluated long-term efficacy and safety in adults with chronic insomnia. Subjects received a single, nightly dose of ramelteon tablets 8 mg or matching placebo for six months. PSG was performed on the first two nights of Week 1 and Months 1, 3, 5, and 6. Ramelteon tablets reduced sleep latency at each time point when compared to placebo. In this study, when the PSG results from nights 1 and 2 of Month 7 were compared to the results from nights 22 and 23 of Month 6, there was a statistically significant increase in LPS of 33% (9.5 minutes) in the ramelteon group. There was no increase in LPS in the placebo group when the same time periods were compared.A randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted in outpatients aged 65 years and older with chronic insomnia and employed subjective measures of efficacy (sleep diaries). Subjects received Ramelteon tablets (4 or 8 mg) or placebo for 35 nights. Ramelteon tablets reduced patient-reported sleep latency compared to placebo. A similarly designed study performed in younger adults (aged 18 to 64 years) using 8 and 16 mg of ramelteon did not replicate this finding of reduced patient-reported sleep latency compared to placebo.While the 16 mg dose was evaluated as a potential treatment for adults, it was shown to confer no additional benefit for sleep initiation and was associated with higher incidences of fatigue, headache and next-day somnolence.Transient InsomniaIn a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial using a first-night-effect model, healthy adults received placebo or ramelteon tablets before spending one night in a sleep laboratory and being evaluated with PSG. Ramelteon tablets demonstrated a decrease in mean latency to persistent sleep as compared to placebo.14.2 Studies Pertinent to Safety Concerns for Sleep-Promoting DrugsResults from Human Laboratory Abuse Liability StudiesA human laboratory abuse potential study was performed in 14 subjects with a history of sedative/hypnotic or anxiolytic drug abuse. Subjects received single oral doses of ramelteon tablets (16, 80, or 160 mg), triazolam (0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 mg) or placebo. All subjects received each of the seven treatments separated by a wash-out period and underwent multiple standard tests of abuse potential. No differences in subjective responses indicative of abuse potential were found between ramelteon tablets and placebo at doses up to 20 times the recommended therapeutic dose. The positive control drug, triazolam, consistently showed a dose-response effect on these subjective measures, as demonstrated by the differences from placebo in peak effect and overall 24 hour effect.Residual Pharmacological Effect in Insomnia TrialsIn order to evaluate potential next-day residual effects, the following scales were used: a Memory Recall Test, a Word List Memory Test, a Visual Analog Mood and Feeling Scale, the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test, and a post sleep questionnaire to assess alertness and ability to concentrate. There was no evidence of next-day residual effect seen after two nights of ramelteon use during the crossover studies.In a 35 night, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adults with chronic insomnia, measures of residual effects were performed at three time points. Overall, the magnitudes of any observed differences were small. At Week 1, patients who received 8 mg of ramelteon tablets had a mean VAS score (46 mm on a 100 mm scale) indicating more fatigue in comparison to patients who received placebo (42 mm). At Week 3, patients who received 8 mg of ramelteon tablet had a lower mean score for immediate recall (7.5 out of 16 words) compared to patients who received placebo (8.2 words); and the patients treated with ramelteon tablet had a mean VAS score indicating more sluggishness (27 mm on a 100 mm VAS) in comparison to the placebo-treated patients (22 mm). Patients who received ramelteon tablet did not have next-morning residual effects that were different from placebo at Week 5.Rebound Insomnia/WithdrawalPotential rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects were assessed in four studies in which subjects received ramelteon tablets or placebo for up to six months; three were 35 day studies, one was a six month study. These studies included a total of 2533 subjects, of whom 854 were elderly.Tyrer Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire (BWSQ)The BWSQ is a self-report questionnaire that solicits specific information on 20 symptoms commonly experienced during withdrawal from benzodiazepine receptor agonists; ramelteon tablets are not a benzodiazepine receptor agonist.In two of the three 35 day insomnia studies, the questionnaire was administered one week after completion of treatment; in the third study, the questionnaire was administered on Days 1 and 2 after completion. In all three of the 35 day studies, subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 4, 8, or 16 mg daily reported BWSQ scores similar to those of subjects receiving placebo.In the six month study, there was no evidence of withdrawal from the 8 mg dose as measured by the BWSQ.Rebound InsomniaRebound insomnia was assessed in the 35 day studies by measuring sleep latency after abrupt treatment discontinuation. One of these studies employed PSG in younger adult subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 8 or 16 mg; the other two studies employed subjective measures of sleep-onset insomnia in elderly subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 4 or 8 mg, and in younger adult subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 8 or 16 mg. There was no evidence that ramelteon tablets caused rebound insomnia during the posttreatment period.14.3 Studies to Evaluate Effects on Endocrine FunctionTwo controlled studies evaluated the effects of ramelteon tablets on endocrine function.In the first trial, ramelteon tablets 16 mg once daily or placebo was administered to 99 healthy volunteer subjects for four weeks. This study evaluated the thyroid axis, adrenal axis and reproductive axis. No clinically significant endocrinopathies were demonstrated in this study. However, the study was limited in its ability to detect such abnormalities due to its limited duration.In the second trial, ramelteon tablets 16 mg once daily or placebo was administered to 122 subjects with chronic insomnia for six months. This study evaluated the thyroid axis, adrenal axis and reproductive axis. There were no significant abnormalities seen in either the thyroid or the adrenal axes. Abnormalities were, however, noted within the reproductive axis. Overall, the mean serum prolactin level change from baseline was 4.9 mcg/L (34% increase) for women in the ramelteon tablets group compared with -0.6 mcg/L (4% decrease) for women in the placebo group (p=0.003). No differences between active- and placebo-treated groups occurred among men. Thirty two percent of all patients who were treated with ramelteon in this study (women and men) had prolactin levels that increased from normal baseline levels compared to 19% of patients who were treated with placebo. Subject-reported menstrual patterns were similar between the two treatment groups.In a 12 month, open-label study in adult and elderly patients, there were two patients who were noted to have abnormal morning cortisol levels, and subsequent abnormal ACTH stimulation tests.A 29 year old female patient was diagnosed with a prolactinoma. The relationship of these events to ramelteon tablets therapy is not clear.\n14.1 Controlled Clinical TrialsChronic InsomniaThree randomized, double-blind trials in subjects with chronic insomnia employing polysomnography (PSG) were provided as objective support of ramelteon tablet\u2019s effectiveness in sleep initiation.One study enrolled younger adults (aged 18 to 64 years, inclusive) with chronic insomnia and employed a parallel design in which the subjects received a single, nightly dose of ramelteon tablet (8 or 16 mg) or matching placebo for 35 days.

Ramelteon tablets demonstrated a decrease in mean latency to persistent sleep as compared to placebo.14.2 Studies Pertinent to Safety Concerns for Sleep-Promoting DrugsResults from Human Laboratory Abuse Liability StudiesA human laboratory abuse potential study was performed in 14 subjects with a history of sedative/hypnotic or anxiolytic drug abuse. Subjects received single oral doses of ramelteon tablets (16, 80, or 160 mg), triazolam (0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 mg) or placebo. All subjects received each of the seven treatments separated by a wash-out period and underwent multiple standard tests of abuse potential. No differences in subjective responses indicative of abuse potential were found between ramelteon tablets and placebo at doses up to 20 times the recommended therapeutic dose. The positive control drug, triazolam, consistently showed a dose-response effect on these subjective measures, as demonstrated by the differences from placebo in peak effect and overall 24 hour effect.Residual Pharmacological Effect in Insomnia TrialsIn order to evaluate potential next-day residual effects, the following scales were used: a Memory Recall Test, a Word List Memory Test, a Visual Analog Mood and Feeling Scale, the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test, and a post sleep questionnaire to assess alertness and ability to concentrate. There was no evidence of next-day residual effect seen after two nights of ramelteon use during the crossover studies.In a 35 night, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adults with chronic insomnia, measures of residual effects were performed at three time points. Overall, the magnitudes of any observed differences were small. At Week 1, patients who received 8 mg of ramelteon tablets had a mean VAS score (46 mm on a 100 mm scale) indicating more fatigue in comparison to patients who received placebo (42 mm). At Week 3, patients who received 8 mg of ramelteon tablet had a lower mean score for immediate recall (7.5 out of 16 words) compared to patients who received placebo (8.2 words); and the patients treated with ramelteon tablet had a mean VAS score indicating more sluggishness (27 mm on a 100 mm VAS) in comparison to the placebo-treated patients (22 mm). Patients who received ramelteon tablet did not have next-morning residual effects that were different from placebo at Week 5.Rebound Insomnia/WithdrawalPotential rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects were assessed in four studies in which subjects received ramelteon tablets or placebo for up to six months; three were 35 day studies, one was a six month study. These studies included a total of 2533 subjects, of whom 854 were elderly.Tyrer Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire (BWSQ)The BWSQ is a self-report questionnaire that solicits specific information on 20 symptoms commonly experienced during withdrawal from benzodiazepine receptor agonists; ramelteon tablets are not a benzodiazepine receptor agonist.In two of the three 35 day insomnia studies, the questionnaire was administered one week after completion of treatment; in the third study, the questionnaire was administered on Days 1 and 2 after completion. In all three of the 35 day studies, subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 4, 8, or 16 mg daily reported BWSQ scores similar to those of subjects receiving placebo.In the six month study, there was no evidence of withdrawal from the 8 mg dose as measured by the BWSQ.Rebound InsomniaRebound insomnia was assessed in the 35 day studies by measuring sleep latency after abrupt treatment discontinuation. One of these studies employed PSG in younger adult subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 8 or 16 mg; the other two studies employed subjective measures of sleep-onset insomnia in elderly subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 4 or 8 mg, and in younger adult subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 8 or 16 mg. There was no evidence that ramelteon tablets caused rebound insomnia during the posttreatment period.14.3 Studies to Evaluate Effects on Endocrine FunctionTwo controlled studies evaluated the effects of ramelteon tablets on endocrine function.In the first trial, ramelteon tablets 16 mg once daily or placebo was administered to 99 healthy volunteer subjects for four weeks. This study evaluated the thyroid axis, adrenal axis and reproductive axis. No clinically significant endocrinopathies were demonstrated in this study. However, the study was limited in its ability to detect such abnormalities due to its limited duration.In the second trial, ramelteon tablets 16 mg once daily or placebo was administered to 122 subjects with chronic insomnia for six months. This study evaluated the thyroid axis, adrenal axis and reproductive axis. There were no significant abnormalities seen in either the thyroid or the adrenal axes. Abnormalities were, however, noted within the reproductive axis. Overall, the mean serum prolactin level change from baseline was 4.9 mcg/L (34% increase) for women in the ramelteon tablets group compared with -0.6 mcg/L (4% decrease) for women in the placebo group (p=0.003). No differences between active- and placebo-treated groups occurred among men. Thirty two percent of all patients who were treated with ramelteon in this study (women and men) had prolactin levels that increased from normal baseline levels compared to 19% of patients who were treated with placebo. Subject-reported menstrual patterns were similar between the two treatment groups.In a 12 month, open-label study in adult and elderly patients, there were two patients who were noted to have abnormal morning cortisol levels, and subsequent abnormal ACTH stimulation tests.A 29 year old female patient was diagnosed with a prolactinoma. The relationship of these events to ramelteon tablets therapy is not clear.\n14.1 Controlled Clinical TrialsChronic InsomniaThree randomized, double-blind trials in subjects with chronic insomnia employing polysomnography (PSG) were provided as objective support of ramelteon tablet\u2019s effectiveness in sleep initiation.One study enrolled younger adults (aged 18 to 64 years, inclusive) with chronic insomnia and employed a parallel design in which the subjects received a single, nightly dose of ramelteon tablet (8 or 16 mg) or matching placebo for 35 days. PSG was performed on the first two nights in each of Weeks 1, 3, and 5 of treatment. Ramelteon tablets reduced the average latency to persistent sleep at each of the time points when compared to placebo. The 16 mg dose conferred no additional benefit for sleep initiation.The second study employing PSG was a three-period crossover trial performed in subjects aged 65 years and older with a history of chronic insomnia. Subjects received ramelteon tablets (4 or 8 mg) or placebo and underwent PSG assessment in a sleep laboratory for two consecutive nights in each of the three study periods. Both doses of ramelteon tablets reduced latency to persistent sleep when compared to placebo.The third study evaluated long-term efficacy and safety in adults with chronic insomnia. Subjects received a single, nightly dose of ramelteon tablets 8 mg or matching placebo for six months. PSG was performed on the first two nights of Week 1 and Months 1, 3, 5, and 6. Ramelteon tablets reduced sleep latency at each time point when compared to placebo. In this study, when the PSG results from nights 1 and 2 of Month 7 were compared to the results from nights 22 and 23 of Month 6, there was a statistically significant increase in LPS of 33% (9.5 minutes) in the ramelteon group. There was no increase in LPS in the placebo group when the same time periods were compared.A randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted in outpatients aged 65 years and older with chronic insomnia and employed subjective measures of efficacy (sleep diaries). Subjects received Ramelteon tablets (4 or 8 mg) or placebo for 35 nights. Ramelteon tablets reduced patient-reported sleep latency compared to placebo. A similarly designed study performed in younger adults (aged 18 to 64 years) using 8 and 16 mg of ramelteon did not replicate this finding of reduced patient-reported sleep latency compared to placebo.While the 16 mg dose was evaluated as a potential treatment for adults, it was shown to confer no additional benefit for sleep initiation and was associated with higher incidences of fatigue, headache and next-day somnolence.Transient InsomniaIn a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial using a first-night-effect model, healthy adults received placebo or ramelteon tablets before spending one night in a sleep laboratory and being evaluated with PSG.
