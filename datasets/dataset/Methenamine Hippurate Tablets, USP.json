    "ACTIONS": "Microbiology:Methenamine hippurate has antibacterial activity because the methenamine component is hydrolyzed to formaldehyde in acid urine. Hippuric acid, the other component, has some antibacterial activity and also acts to keep the urine acid. The drug is generally active againstE. coli,enterococci and staphylococci.Enterobacter aerogenesis generally resistant. The urine must be kept sufficiently acid for urea-splitting organisms such asProteusandPseudomonasto be inhibited.Susceptibility TestingFor specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC.Human Pharmacology:Within 1/2 hour after ingestion of a single 1-gram dose of methenamine hippurate, antibacterial activity is demonstrable in the urine. Urine has continuous antibacterial activity when methenamine hippurate is administered at the recommended dosage schedule of\u00a01 gram twice daily. Over 90% of methenamine moiety is excreted in the urine within 24 hours after administration of a single 1-gram dose. Similarly, the hippurate moiety is rapidly absorbed and excreted, and it reaches the urine by both tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. This action may be important in older patients or in those with some degree of renal impairment.\nMicrobiology:Methenamine hippurate has antibacterial activity because the methenamine component is hydrolyzed to formaldehyde in acid urine.

    "PRECAUTIONS": "Prescribing methenamine hippurate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.Care should be taken to maintain an acid pH of the urine, especially when treating infections due to urea-splitting organisms such asProteusand strains ofPseudomonas.In a few instances in one study, the serum transaminase levels were slightly elevated during treatment but returned to normal while the patients were still taking methenamine hippurate. Because\u00a0 of\u00a0 this\u00a0 report,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0 recommended\u00a0 that\u00a0 liver\u00a0 function\u00a0 studies\u00a0 be\u00a0 performed periodically on patients taking the drug, especially those with liver dysfunction.Use in Pregnancy: In early pregnancy the safe use of methenamine hippurate is not established. In the last trimester, safety is suggested, but not definitely proved. No adverse effects on the fetus were seen in studies in pregnant rats and rabbits. Methenamine hippurate taken during pregnancy can interfere with laboratory tests of urine estriol (resulting in unmeasurably low values) when acid hydrolysis is used in the laboratory procedure. This interference is due to the presence in the urine of methenamine and/or formaldehyde. Enzymatic hydrolysis, in place of acid hydrolysis, will circumvent this problem.Geriatric UseClinical studies of methenamine hippurate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.Methenamine hippurate is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency and severe hepatic insufficiency (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).Information for PatientsPatients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including methenamine hippurate should only be used to treat bacterial infections.

When methenamine hippurate is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by methenamine hippurate or other antibacterial drugs in the future.\nPrescribing methenamine hippurate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.Care should be taken to maintain an acid pH of the urine, especially when treating infections due to urea-splitting organisms such asProteusand strains ofPseudomonas.In a few instances in one study, the serum transaminase levels were slightly elevated during treatment but returned to normal while the patients were still taking methenamine hippurate. Because\u00a0 of\u00a0 this\u00a0 report,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0 recommended\u00a0 that\u00a0 liver\u00a0 function\u00a0 studies\u00a0 be\u00a0 performed periodically on patients taking the drug, especially those with liver dysfunction.Use in Pregnancy: In early pregnancy the safe use of methenamine hippurate is not established. In the last trimester, safety is suggested, but not definitely proved. No adverse effects on the fetus were seen in studies in pregnant rats and rabbits. Methenamine hippurate taken during pregnancy can interfere with laboratory tests of urine estriol (resulting in unmeasurably low values) when acid hydrolysis is used in the laboratory procedure. This interference is due to the presence in the urine of methenamine and/or formaldehyde. Enzymatic hydrolysis, in place of acid hydrolysis, will circumvent this problem.Geriatric UseClinical studies of methenamine hippurate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.Methenamine hippurate is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency and severe hepatic insufficiency (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).Information for PatientsPatients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including methenamine hippurate should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When methenamine hippurate is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by methenamine hippurate or other antibacterial drugs in the future.",
