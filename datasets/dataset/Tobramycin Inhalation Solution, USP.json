    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1 BronchospasmBronchospasm can occur with inhalation oftobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies withtobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate.5.2 OtotoxicityOtotoxicity with use of Tobramycin Inhalation SolutionOtotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides.Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when takingtobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuingtobramycin inhalation solution.Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA VariantsCases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies.5.3 NephrotoxicityNephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuingtobramycin inhalation solution.5.4 Neuromuscular DisordersAminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary.5.5 Embryo-fetal ToxicityAminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposedin utero. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic AminoglycosidesPatients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored.\n5.1 BronchospasmBronchospasm can occur with inhalation oftobramycin inhalation solution.

Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when takingtobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuingtobramycin inhalation solution.Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA VariantsCases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies.5.3 NephrotoxicityNephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuingtobramycin inhalation solution.5.4 Neuromuscular DisordersAminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary.5.5 Embryo-fetal ToxicityAminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposedin utero. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic AminoglycosidesPatients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored.\n5.1 BronchospasmBronchospasm can occur with inhalation oftobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies withtobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate.5.2 OtotoxicityOtotoxicity with use of Tobramycin Inhalation SolutionOtotoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides.Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies.

Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks.Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase\u00a03 studies.Table 1: Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >5% of Tobramycin Inhalation SolutionPatientsAdverse ReactionTobramycinInhalation Solution(n=258)%Placebo(n=262)%Cough IncreasedPharyngitisSputum IncreasedDyspneaHemoptysisLung Function Decreased1Voice AlterationTaste PerversionRash46.138.037.633.719.416.312.86.65.447.339.339.738.523.715.36.56.96.11Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration.Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated withtobramycin inhalation solution:Ear and Labyrinth Disorders:TinnitusMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:MyalgiaInfections and Infestations:LaryngitisVoice Alteration and TinnitusVoice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods.Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups.Changes in Serum CreatinineNine (3%) patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the tobramycin inhalation solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit.6.2 Postmarketing ExperienceThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use oftobramycin inhalation solution.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryAminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy(see Clinical Considerations).In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies(see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal RiskCystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery.DataAnimal DataNo reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted withtobramycin (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the presence oftobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant(see Clinical Considerations).The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need fortobramycin inhalation solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tobramycin inhalation solution or from the underlying maternal condition.Clinical ConsiderationsTobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).8.4 Pediatric UseThe safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age[see Indications and Usage (1)\u00a0and Dosage and Administration (2)].8.5 Geriatric UseClinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryAminoglycosides can cause fetal harm.

Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).8.4 Pediatric UseThe safety and efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of tobramycin inhalation solution is not indicated in children <6 years of age[see Indications and Usage (1)\u00a0and Dosage and Administration (2)].8.5 Geriatric UseClinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryAminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].Although there are no available data on tobramycin inhalation solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy(see Clinical Considerations).In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies(see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal RiskCystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery.DataAnimal DataNo reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted withtobramycin (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin \u226540 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the presence oftobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The percentage of patients withP. aeruginosaisolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.\nTwo identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients withP.aeruginosa. Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or hadBurkholderia cepaciaisolated from sputum were excluded.All subjects had baseline FEV1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor.Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical StudiesCycle 1Cycle 2Cycle 328 days28 days28 days28 days28 days28 daysTobramycin InhalationSolutionregimenn=258Tobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mg twicedailyNo drugTobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mgtwice dailyNo drugTobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mg twice dailyNo drugPlaceboregimenn=262placebotwice dailyNo drugplacebotwice dailyNo drugplacebotwice dailyNo drugAll patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b22-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech).In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV1% predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2,tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV1% predicted over 24 weeks for both studies.In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number ofP. aeruginosacolony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2).Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients.

However,\u00a0four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial withP. aeruginosaisolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV1or a decrease in sputum bacterial density.Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority ofP. aeruginosaisolates during the 6-month studies. However, someP. aeruginosaisolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients withP. aeruginosaisolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.\nTwo identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients withP.aeruginosa. Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or hadBurkholderia cepaciaisolated from sputum were excluded.All subjects had baseline FEV1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor.Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical StudiesCycle 1Cycle 2Cycle 328 days28 days28 days28 days28 days28 daysTobramycin InhalationSolutionregimenn=258Tobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mg twicedailyNo drugTobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mgtwice dailyNo drugTobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mg twice dailyNo drugPlaceboregimenn=262placebotwice dailyNo drugplacebotwice dailyNo drugplacebotwice dailyNo drugAll patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b22-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech).In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV1% predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2,tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV1% predicted over 24 weeks for both studies.In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number ofP. aeruginosacolony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods.

Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials.The relationship betweenin vitrosusceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However,\u00a0four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial withP. aeruginosaisolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV1or a decrease in sputum bacterial density.Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority ofP. aeruginosaisolates during the 6-month studies. However, someP. aeruginosaisolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients withP. aeruginosaisolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.\nTwo identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients withP.aeruginosa. Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or hadBurkholderia cepaciaisolated from sputum were excluded.All subjects had baseline FEV1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor.Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical StudiesCycle 1Cycle 2Cycle 328 days28 days28 days28 days28 days28 daysTobramycin InhalationSolutionregimenn=258Tobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mg twicedailyNo drugTobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mgtwice dailyNo drugTobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mg twice dailyNo drugPlaceboregimenn=262placebotwice dailyNo drugplacebotwice dailyNo drugplacebotwice dailyNo drugAll patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b22-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech).In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV1% predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients.

Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2).Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials.The relationship betweenin vitrosusceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However,\u00a0four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial withP. aeruginosaisolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV1or a decrease in sputum bacterial density.Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority ofP. aeruginosaisolates during the 6-month studies. However, someP. aeruginosaisolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients withP. aeruginosaisolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.\nTwo identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients withP.aeruginosa. Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or hadBurkholderia cepaciaisolated from sputum were excluded.All subjects had baseline FEV1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor.Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical StudiesCycle 1Cycle 2Cycle 328 days28 days28 days28 days28 days28 daysTobramycin InhalationSolutionregimenn=258Tobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mg twicedailyNo drugTobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mgtwice dailyNo drugTobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mg twice dailyNo drugPlaceboregimenn=262placebotwice dailyNo drugplacebotwice dailyNo drugplacebotwice dailyNo drugAll patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b22-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech).In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the tobramycin inhalation solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV1% predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients.

Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV1% predicted over 24 weeks for both studies.In each study, tobramycin inhalation solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number ofP. aeruginosacolony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2).Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal, antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials.The relationship betweenin vitrosusceptibility test results and clinical outcome with tobramycin inhalation solution therapy is not clear. However,\u00a0four tobramycin inhalation solution patients who began the clinical trial withP. aeruginosaisolates having MIC values \u2265128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV1or a decrease in sputum bacterial density.Treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority ofP. aeruginosaisolates during the 6-month studies. However, someP. aeruginosaisolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients withP. aeruginosaisolates with tobramycin MICs \u226516 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the tobramycin inhalation solution regimen.\nTwo identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients withP.aeruginosa. Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of >2 mg/dL, or hadBurkholderia cepaciaisolated from sputum were excluded.All subjects had baseline FEV1 % predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received tobramycin inhalation solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor.Table 2: Dosing Regimens in Clinical StudiesCycle 1Cycle 2Cycle 328 days28 days28 days28 days28 days28 daysTobramycin InhalationSolutionregimenn=258Tobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mg twicedailyNo drugTobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mgtwice dailyNo drugTobramycin Inhalation Solution300 mg twice dailyNo drugPlaceboregimenn=262placebotwice dailyNo drugplacebotwice dailyNo drugplacebotwice dailyNo drugAll patients received either tobramycin inhalation solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, \u03b22-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques.
