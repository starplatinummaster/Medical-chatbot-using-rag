    "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "MechanismofActionTimolol maleate  is a beta1and  beta2(non-selective)  adrenergic receptor blocking  agent that does not  have  significant  intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct  myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity.Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduces cardiac output  in  both healthy subjects and patients with heart  disease. In patients with severe impairment of myocardial function, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may inhibit the stimulatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system necessary to maintain adequate cardiac function.Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade  in the bronchi  and  bronchioles results in increased airway resistance from unopposed parasympathetic activity. Such an effect in patients with asthma  or  other bronchospastic conditions  is  potentially  dangerous.Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, when applied topically on the eye, has the action  of reducing elevated as well  as  normal  intraocular  pressure,  whether  or  not accompanied by  glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor  in the pathogenesis of  glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level  of  intraocular pressure, the greater  the  likelihood  of  glaucomatous  visual  field  loss  and  optic  nerve  damage.The onset of reduction in intraocular pressure following administration of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution can usually be detected within  one-half hour after a single dose. The maximum effect usually occurs in one to two hours, and  significant lowering of  intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods as  long  as 24  hours  with a single dose. Repeated observations  over a period of  one year indicate that the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is well maintained.The precise mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is not  clearly  established at this time.

In patients with severe impairment of myocardial function, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may inhibit the stimulatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system necessary to maintain adequate cardiac function.Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade  in the bronchi  and  bronchioles results in increased airway resistance from unopposed parasympathetic activity.

Such an effect in patients with asthma  or  other bronchospastic conditions  is  potentially  dangerous.Timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, when applied topically on the eye, has the action  of reducing elevated as well  as  normal  intraocular  pressure,  whether  or  not accompanied by  glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor  in the pathogenesis of  glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level  of  intraocular pressure, the greater  the  likelihood  of  glaucomatous  visual  field  loss  and  optic  nerve  damage.The onset of reduction in intraocular pressure following administration of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution can usually be detected within  one-half hour after a single dose. The maximum effect usually occurs in one to two hours, and  significant lowering of  intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods as  long  as 24  hours  with a single dose. Repeated observations  over a period of  one year indicate that the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is well maintained.The precise mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is not  clearly  established at this time. Tonography  and fluorophotometry studies in man suggest that its predominant action may be related to reduced aqueous  formation. However,  in some studies a slight increase in outflow facility was  also observed.PharmacokineticsIn a study of  plasma drug concentration in six subjects, the  systemic exposure to timolol was determined following twice daily administration of timolol maleateophthalmic solution 0.5%. The mean peak plasma concentration following  morning  dosing  was  0.46  ng/mL  and  following  afternoon dosing was  0.35  ng/mL.ClinicalStudiesIn controlled multiclinic studies  in  patients  with  untreated intraocular pressures of  22 mmHg or greater, timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.25% or 0.5% administered twice a day produced a greater reduction  in  intraocular pressure than 1,  2, 3, or 4%  pilocarpine solution administered four times a day or 0.5,  1, or 2%  epinephrine hydrochloride solution  administered twice a day.In these studies, timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was generally well tolerated and  produced  fewer  and  less severe side effects than either pilocarpine or epinephrine.

    "WARNINGS": "As with many topically  applied ophthalmic drugs, this drug  is  absorbed systemically.The same adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic  blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure, have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).CardiacFailureSympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of  the circulation in  individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure.In Patients without a History  of Cardiac Failurecontinued  depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents  over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution should be  discontinued.Obstructive Pulmonary  DiseasePatients with chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild  or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease,  or  a history of bronchospastic disease (other than  bronchial  asthma  or a history of  bronchial asthma, in which timolol maleateophthalmic solution is contraindicated(see CONTRAINDICATIONS))should, in general, not receive beta-blockers, including preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution.Major SurgeryThe necessity or  desirability of  withdrawal  of beta-adrenergic blocking  agents prior to major surgery  is controversial.

    "PRECAUTIONS": "GeneralBecause of potential effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on blood pressure and pulse, these agents should be  used with caution in patients  with cerebrovascular insufficiency. If signs or symptoms suggesting reduced cerebral blood flow develop following initiation of therapy with preservative-free  timolol maleateophthalmic solution, alternative therapy should be considered.Choroidal detachment after filtration procedures has been reported with the administration of aqueous suppressant therapy (e.g., timolol).Angle-closure glaucoma:In patients with  angle-closure  glaucoma, the immediate objective of treatment is to reopen the angle. This requires constricting the pupil. Timolol maleate has little or no effect on the pupil. Timolol maleateophthalmic solution should not be used alone in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma.Anaphylaxis:While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history  of atopy or a history  of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or  therapeutic challenge with such  allergens.  Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual  doses  of  epinephrine  used to treat anaphylactic reactions.Muscle weakness:Beta-adrenergic  blockade has been  reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has  been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.Information for PatientsPatients should be instructed about the use of preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution.Since sterility cannot be  maintained  after the individual unit  is  opened, patients should be instructed to use the product immediately after opening and to discard the individual unit and any remaining contents immediately after use.Patients with  bronchial  asthma, a history of  bronchial  asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease, sinus  bradycardia, second or third degree atrioventricular block,  or  cardiac  failure  should  be  advised not to take this product(see CONTRAINDICATIONS).Drug InteractionsAlthough timolol maleateophthalmic solution used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with timolol maleateophthalmic solution and epinephrine has  been reported occasionally.Beta-adrenergic blocking agents:Patients who  are receiving a beta-adrenergic  blocking agent orally and preservative-free timolol  maleateophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents  is not recommended.Calcium antagonists:Caution should be used in the co-administration  of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists, because  of  possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should  be  avoided.Catecholamine-depleting drugs:Close observation  of the patient is  recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope,  or  postural hypotension.Digitalis and calciumantagonists:The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis  and calcium antagonists may have additive  effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time.CYP2D6inhibitors:Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol.Clonidine:Oral beta-adrenergic blocking  agents may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of  clonidine. There have been no reports of exacerbation of rebound hypertension with ophthalmic timolol maleate.Injectableepinephrine:(see PRECAUTIONS,General, Anaphylaxis)Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityIn a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant  increase in the incidence of adrenal  pheochromocytomas  in  male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 42,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose).  Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 14,000 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose.In a lifetime oral  study  in mice, there  were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at  500 mg/kg/day (approximately 71,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended  human  ophthalmic dose), but not  at 5 or  50 mg/kg/day (approximately  700 or 7,000 times, respectively, the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human  ophthalmic dose). In a subsequent study in female mice, in  which  post-mortem  examinations  were  limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was  again observed  at  500 mg/kg/day.The increased occurrence  of mammary adenocarcinomas  was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which  occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not  at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence  of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has  been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents  that  elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin  levels  and mammary tumors has  been  established  in  humans. Furthermore, in  adult  human female subjects who received oral  dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended  human oral dosage), there were  no clinically meaningful  changes  in serum prolactin.Timolol maleate was  devoid  of  mutagenic  potential  when  testedinvivo(mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses  up to 800 mg/kg) andinvitroin a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000  or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated  with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays),  but not  in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship  was  observed,  and the ratio of test to control revertants did  not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is  usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test.Reproduction and fertility studies in rats demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility  at  doses up to 21,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose.Pregnancy:TeratogenicEffects:Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day  (7,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human  ophthalmic  dose) demonstrated no  evidence  of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification  was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (142,000 times the systemic exposure  following the maximum recommended human  ophthalmic  dose)  were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions  were  also  seen  in rabbits at doses of 14,000 times the  systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic  dose, in this case without  apparent maternotoxicity.There are  no  adequate  and well-controlled studies in  pregnant  women. Preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Nursing MothersTimolol maleate  has  been  detected  in  human  milk  following oral and  ophthalmic  drug administration. Because of the potential for serious adverse  reactions from timolol in nursing infants, a decision should  be made whether to discontinue nursing  or to discontinue the drug, taking   into  account the importance  of the drug to the mother.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have   been established when administered in pediatric  patients aged 2 years and older.  Use of  timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these children is supported  by  evidence from adequate  and well-controlled studies in children and adults. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age  of 2 years have not  been  established.Geriatric UseNo overall  differences  in  safety  or  effectiveness   have  been observed  between  elderly and   younger  patients.\nGeneralBecause of potential effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on blood pressure and pulse, these agents should be  used with caution in patients  with cerebrovascular insufficiency. If signs or symptoms suggesting reduced cerebral blood flow develop following initiation of therapy with preservative-free  timolol maleateophthalmic solution, alternative therapy should be considered.Choroidal detachment after filtration procedures has been reported with the administration of aqueous suppressant therapy (e.g., timolol).Angle-closure glaucoma:In patients with  angle-closure  glaucoma, the immediate objective of treatment is to reopen the angle. This requires constricting the pupil. Timolol maleate has little or no effect on the pupil. Timolol maleateophthalmic solution should not be used alone in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma.Anaphylaxis:While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history  of atopy or a history  of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or  therapeutic challenge with such  allergens.  Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual  doses  of  epinephrine  used to treat anaphylactic reactions.Muscle weakness:Beta-adrenergic  blockade has been  reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has  been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.Information for PatientsPatients should be instructed about the use of preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution.Since sterility cannot be  maintained  after the individual unit  is  opened, patients should be instructed to use the product immediately after opening and to discard the individual unit and any remaining contents immediately after use.Patients with  bronchial  asthma, a history of  bronchial  asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease, sinus  bradycardia, second or third degree atrioventricular block,  or  cardiac  failure  should  be  advised not to take this product(see CONTRAINDICATIONS).Drug InteractionsAlthough timolol maleateophthalmic solution used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with timolol maleateophthalmic solution and epinephrine has  been reported occasionally.Beta-adrenergic blocking agents:Patients who  are receiving a beta-adrenergic  blocking agent orally and preservative-free timolol  maleateophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure.

Timolol has  been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.Information for PatientsPatients should be instructed about the use of preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution.Since sterility cannot be  maintained  after the individual unit  is  opened, patients should be instructed to use the product immediately after opening and to discard the individual unit and any remaining contents immediately after use.Patients with  bronchial  asthma, a history of  bronchial  asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease, sinus  bradycardia, second or third degree atrioventricular block,  or  cardiac  failure  should  be  advised not to take this product(see CONTRAINDICATIONS).Drug InteractionsAlthough timolol maleateophthalmic solution used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with timolol maleateophthalmic solution and epinephrine has  been reported occasionally.Beta-adrenergic blocking agents:Patients who  are receiving a beta-adrenergic  blocking agent orally and preservative-free timolol  maleateophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents  is not recommended.Calcium antagonists:Caution should be used in the co-administration  of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists, because  of  possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should  be  avoided.Catecholamine-depleting drugs:Close observation  of the patient is  recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope,  or  postural hypotension.Digitalis and calciumantagonists:The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis  and calcium antagonists may have additive  effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time.CYP2D6inhibitors:Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol.Clonidine:Oral beta-adrenergic blocking  agents may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of  clonidine. There have been no reports of exacerbation of rebound hypertension with ophthalmic timolol maleate.Injectableepinephrine:(see PRECAUTIONS,General, Anaphylaxis)Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityIn a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant  increase in the incidence of adrenal  pheochromocytomas  in  male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 42,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose).  Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 14,000 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose.In a lifetime oral  study  in mice, there  were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at  500 mg/kg/day (approximately 71,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended  human  ophthalmic dose), but not  at 5 or  50 mg/kg/day (approximately  700 or 7,000 times, respectively, the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human  ophthalmic dose). In a subsequent study in female mice, in  which  post-mortem  examinations  were  limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was  again observed  at  500 mg/kg/day.The increased occurrence  of mammary adenocarcinomas  was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which  occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not  at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence  of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has  been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents  that  elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin  levels  and mammary tumors has  been  established  in  humans. Furthermore, in  adult  human female subjects who received oral  dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended  human oral dosage), there were  no clinically meaningful  changes  in serum prolactin.Timolol maleate was  devoid  of  mutagenic  potential  when  testedinvivo(mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses  up to 800 mg/kg) andinvitroin a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000  or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated  with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays),  but not  in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship  was  observed,  and the ratio of test to control revertants did  not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is  usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test.Reproduction and fertility studies in rats demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility  at  doses up to 21,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose.Pregnancy:TeratogenicEffects:Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day  (7,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human  ophthalmic  dose) demonstrated no  evidence  of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification  was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (142,000 times the systemic exposure  following the maximum recommended human  ophthalmic  dose)  were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions  were  also  seen  in rabbits at doses of 14,000 times the  systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic  dose, in this case without  apparent maternotoxicity.There are  no  adequate  and well-controlled studies in  pregnant  women. Preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Nursing MothersTimolol maleate  has  been  detected  in  human  milk  following oral and  ophthalmic  drug administration. Because of the potential for serious adverse  reactions from timolol in nursing infants, a decision should  be made whether to discontinue nursing  or to discontinue the drug, taking   into  account the importance  of the drug to the mother.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have   been established when administered in pediatric  patients aged 2 years and older.  Use of  timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these children is supported  by  evidence from adequate  and well-controlled studies in children and adults. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age  of 2 years have not  been  established.Geriatric UseNo overall  differences  in  safety  or  effectiveness   have  been observed  between  elderly and   younger  patients.\nGeneralBecause of potential effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on blood pressure and pulse, these agents should be  used with caution in patients  with cerebrovascular insufficiency. If signs or symptoms suggesting reduced cerebral blood flow develop following initiation of therapy with preservative-free  timolol maleateophthalmic solution, alternative therapy should be considered.Choroidal detachment after filtration procedures has been reported with the administration of aqueous suppressant therapy (e.g., timolol).Angle-closure glaucoma:In patients with  angle-closure  glaucoma, the immediate objective of treatment is to reopen the angle. This requires constricting the pupil. Timolol maleate has little or no effect on the pupil. Timolol maleateophthalmic solution should not be used alone in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma.Anaphylaxis:While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history  of atopy or a history  of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or  therapeutic challenge with such  allergens.

Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual  doses  of  epinephrine  used to treat anaphylactic reactions.Muscle weakness:Beta-adrenergic  blockade has been  reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has  been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.Information for PatientsPatients should be instructed about the use of preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution.Since sterility cannot be  maintained  after the individual unit  is  opened, patients should be instructed to use the product immediately after opening and to discard the individual unit and any remaining contents immediately after use.Patients with  bronchial  asthma, a history of  bronchial  asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease, sinus  bradycardia, second or third degree atrioventricular block,  or  cardiac  failure  should  be  advised not to take this product(see CONTRAINDICATIONS).Drug InteractionsAlthough timolol maleateophthalmic solution used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with timolol maleateophthalmic solution and epinephrine has  been reported occasionally.Beta-adrenergic blocking agents:Patients who  are receiving a beta-adrenergic  blocking agent orally and preservative-free timolol  maleateophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents  is not recommended.Calcium antagonists:Caution should be used in the co-administration  of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists, because  of  possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should  be  avoided.Catecholamine-depleting drugs:Close observation  of the patient is  recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope,  or  postural hypotension.Digitalis and calciumantagonists:The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis  and calcium antagonists may have additive  effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time.CYP2D6inhibitors:Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol.Clonidine:Oral beta-adrenergic blocking  agents may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of  clonidine. There have been no reports of exacerbation of rebound hypertension with ophthalmic timolol maleate.Injectableepinephrine:(see PRECAUTIONS,General, Anaphylaxis)Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityIn a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant  increase in the incidence of adrenal  pheochromocytomas  in  male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 42,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose).  Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 14,000 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose.In a lifetime oral  study  in mice, there  were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at  500 mg/kg/day (approximately 71,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended  human  ophthalmic dose), but not  at 5 or  50 mg/kg/day (approximately  700 or 7,000 times, respectively, the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human  ophthalmic dose). In a subsequent study in female mice, in  which  post-mortem  examinations  were  limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was  again observed  at  500 mg/kg/day.The increased occurrence  of mammary adenocarcinomas  was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which  occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not  at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence  of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has  been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents  that  elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin  levels  and mammary tumors has  been  established  in  humans. Furthermore, in  adult  human female subjects who received oral  dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended  human oral dosage), there were  no clinically meaningful  changes  in serum prolactin.Timolol maleate was  devoid  of  mutagenic  potential  when  testedinvivo(mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses  up to 800 mg/kg) andinvitroin a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000  or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated  with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays),  but not  in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship  was  observed,  and the ratio of test to control revertants did  not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is  usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test.Reproduction and fertility studies in rats demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility  at  doses up to 21,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose.Pregnancy:TeratogenicEffects:Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day  (7,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human  ophthalmic  dose) demonstrated no  evidence  of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification  was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (142,000 times the systemic exposure  following the maximum recommended human  ophthalmic  dose)  were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions  were  also  seen  in rabbits at doses of 14,000 times the  systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic  dose, in this case without  apparent maternotoxicity.There are  no  adequate  and well-controlled studies in  pregnant  women. Preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Nursing MothersTimolol maleate  has  been  detected  in  human  milk  following oral and  ophthalmic  drug administration. Because of the potential for serious adverse  reactions from timolol in nursing infants, a decision should  be made whether to discontinue nursing  or to discontinue the drug, taking   into  account the importance  of the drug to the mother.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have   been established when administered in pediatric  patients aged 2 years and older.  Use of  timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in these children is supported  by  evidence from adequate  and well-controlled studies in children and adults. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age  of 2 years have not  been  established.Geriatric UseNo overall  differences  in  safety  or  effectiveness   have  been observed  between  elderly and   younger  patients.\nGeneralBecause of potential effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on blood pressure and pulse, these agents should be  used with caution in patients  with cerebrovascular insufficiency. If signs or symptoms suggesting reduced cerebral blood flow develop following initiation of therapy with preservative-free  timolol maleateophthalmic solution, alternative therapy should be considered.Choroidal detachment after filtration procedures has been reported with the administration of aqueous suppressant therapy (e.g., timolol).Angle-closure glaucoma:In patients with  angle-closure  glaucoma, the immediate objective of treatment is to reopen the angle. This requires constricting the pupil. Timolol maleate has little or no effect on the pupil. Timolol maleateophthalmic solution should not be used alone in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma.Anaphylaxis:While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history  of atopy or a history  of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or  therapeutic challenge with such  allergens.

    "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION": "Preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution is a sterile solution that does not contain a preservative. The solution from one individual  unit is to be used immediately  after opening for administration to one or  both eyes. Since sterility cannot be  guaranteed after the individual unit is opened, the remaining contents should be discarded immediately after administration.Preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution is available in concentration of 0.5%. The usual starting dose is one drop of 0.25% preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution in the affected  eye(s)  administered twice a day. Apply  enough  gentle pressure on the individual  container to obtain a single drop of solution. If the clinical response is  not  adequate, the dosage may be  changed to one  drop  of 0.5%  solution  in the affected  eye(s)  administered twice a day.Since in some patients the pressure-lowering response to preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution may require a few weeks to stabilize, evaluation should include a determination of intraocular pressure after approximately 4 weeks of treatment with preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution.If the intraocular pressure is  maintained at satisfactory levels, the dosage schedule may be changed to one  drop once a day  in the affected  eye(s). Because of  diurnal variations in intraocular pressure, satisfactory response to the once-a-day dose is  best determined by measuring the intraocular  pressure  at  different times during the  day.Dosages above one drop of 0.5% timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice a day generally  have not been shown to produce  further reduction in intraocular pressure.  If the patient's intraocular  pressure  is still not at a satisfactory level on this regimen, concomitant therapy with other  agent(s) for lowering intraocular  pressure can be instituted taking  into consideration that the preparation(s) used  concomitantly may contain one  or more preservatives.

The solution from one individual  unit is to be used immediately  after opening for administration to one or  both eyes. Since sterility cannot be  guaranteed after the individual unit is opened, the remaining contents should be discarded immediately after administration.Preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution is available in concentration of 0.5%. The usual starting dose is one drop of 0.25% preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution in the affected  eye(s)  administered twice a day. Apply  enough  gentle pressure on the individual  container to obtain a single drop of solution. If the clinical response is  not  adequate, the dosage may be  changed to one  drop  of 0.5%  solution  in the affected  eye(s)  administered twice a day.Since in some patients the pressure-lowering response to preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution may require a few weeks to stabilize, evaluation should include a determination of intraocular pressure after approximately 4 weeks of treatment with preservative-free timolol maleateophthalmic solution.If the intraocular pressure is  maintained at satisfactory levels, the dosage schedule may be changed to one  drop once a day  in the affected  eye(s). Because of  diurnal variations in intraocular pressure, satisfactory response to the once-a-day dose is  best determined by measuring the intraocular  pressure  at  different times during the  day.Dosages above one drop of 0.5% timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice a day generally  have not been shown to produce  further reduction in intraocular pressure.
