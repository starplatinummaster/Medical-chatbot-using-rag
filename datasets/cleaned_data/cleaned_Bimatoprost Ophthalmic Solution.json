    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1 PigmentationBimatoprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid) and eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as bimatoprost is administered. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of bimatoprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. The long term effects of increased pigmentation are not known.Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly.5.2 Eyelash ChangesBimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye. These changes include increased length, thickness, and number of lashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.5.3 Intraocular InflammationProstaglandin analogs, including bimatoprost, have been reported to cause intraocular inflammation. In addition, because these products may exacerbate inflammation, caution should be used in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., uveitis).5.4 Macular EdemaMacular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution. Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.5.5 Bacterial KeratitisThere have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface.5.6 Contact Lens UseBimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% contains benzalkonium chloride, which may be absorbed by and cause discoloration of soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% and may be reinserted 15 minutes following its administration.\n5.1 PigmentationBimatoprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% administration in pregnant women. There is no increase in the risk of major birth defects or miscarriages based on bimatoprost postmarketing experience.In embryofetal developmental studies, administration of bimatoprost in pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis, resulted in abortion and early delivery at oral doses at least 33 times (mice) or 94 times (rats) the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose (based on blood area under the curve [AUC] levels). These adverse effects were not observed at 2.6 times (mice) and 47 times (rats) the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose.In pre/postnatal development studies, administration of bimatoprost to pregnant rats from organogenesis to the end of lactation resulted in reduced gestation length and fetal body weight, and increased fetal and pup mortality at oral doses at least 41 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended clinical dose (based on blood AUC levels).  No adverse effects were observed in rat offspring at exposures estimated at 14 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose (based on blood AUC levels).Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.DataAnimal DataIn an embryofetal development rat study, abortion was observed in pregnant rats administered bimatoprost orally during organogenesis at 0.6 mg/kg/day (94 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended human ophthalmic dose [RHOD], based on AUC). The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for abortion was 0.3 mg/kg/day (estimated at 47 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC). No abnormalities were observed in rat fetuses at doses up to 0.6 mg/kg/day.In an embryofetal development mouse study, abortion and early delivery were observed in pregnant mice administered bimatoprost orally during organogenesis at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg/day (33 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC). The NOAEL for abortion and early delivery was 0.1 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC). No abnormalities were observed in mouse fetuses at doses up to 0.6 mg/kg/day (72 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC).In a pre/postnatal development study, treatment of pregnant rats with bimatoprost orally from gestation day 7 to lactation day 20 resulted in reduced gestation length, increased late resorptions, fetal deaths, and postnatal pup mortality, and reduced pup body weight at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg/day. These effects were observed at exposures at least 41 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC. The NOAEL for postnatal development and mating performance of the offspring was 0.1 mg/kg/day (estimated at 14 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC).8.2 LactationRisk SummaryIt is not known whether topical ocular treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. In animal studies, bimatoprost has been shown to be present in breast milk of lactating rats at an intravenous dose (i.e., 1 mg/kg) 324 times the RHOD (on a m2g/m basis), however no animal data is available at clinically relevant doses.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for bimatoprost ophthalmic solution, 0.03% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from bimatoprost ophthalmic solution, 0.03%.8.4 Pediatric UseUse in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years is not recommended because of potential safety concerns related to increased pigmentation following long-term chronic use.8.5 Geriatric UseNo overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients.\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% administration in pregnant women.

These adverse effects were not observed at 2.6 times (mice) and 47 times (rats) the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose.In pre/postnatal development studies, administration of bimatoprost to pregnant rats from organogenesis to the end of lactation resulted in reduced gestation length and fetal body weight, and increased fetal and pup mortality at oral doses at least 41 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended clinical dose (based on blood AUC levels).  No adverse effects were observed in rat offspring at exposures estimated at 14 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose (based on blood AUC levels).Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.DataAnimal DataIn an embryofetal development rat study, abortion was observed in pregnant rats administered bimatoprost orally during organogenesis at 0.6 mg/kg/day (94 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended human ophthalmic dose [RHOD], based on AUC). The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for abortion was 0.3 mg/kg/day (estimated at 47 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC). No abnormalities were observed in rat fetuses at doses up to 0.6 mg/kg/day.In an embryofetal development mouse study, abortion and early delivery were observed in pregnant mice administered bimatoprost orally during organogenesis at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg/day (33 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC). The NOAEL for abortion and early delivery was 0.1 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC). No abnormalities were observed in mouse fetuses at doses up to 0.6 mg/kg/day (72 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC).In a pre/postnatal development study, treatment of pregnant rats with bimatoprost orally from gestation day 7 to lactation day 20 resulted in reduced gestation length, increased late resorptions, fetal deaths, and postnatal pup mortality, and reduced pup body weight at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg/day. These effects were observed at exposures at least 41 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC. The NOAEL for postnatal development and mating performance of the offspring was 0.1 mg/kg/day (estimated at 14 times the human systemic exposure at the RHOD, based on AUC).8.2 LactationRisk SummaryIt is not known whether topical ocular treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk.

    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "12.1 Mechanism of ActionBimatoprost, a prostaglandin analog, is a synthetic structural analog of prostaglandin with ocular hypotensive activity. It selectively mimics the effects of naturally occurring substances, prostamides. Bimatoprost is believed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in humans by increasing outflow of aqueous humor through both the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral routes. Elevated IOP presents a major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss.12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorptionAfter one drop of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% was administered once daily to both eyes of 15 healthy subjects for two weeks, blood concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and were below the lower limit of detection (0.025 ng/mL) in most subjects within 1.5 hours after dosing. Mean Cmaxand AUC0 to 24hrvalues were similar on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/mL and 0.09 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively, indicating that steady state was reached during the first week of ocular dosing. There was no significant systemic drug accumulation over time.DistributionBimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues with a steady-state volume of distribution of 0.67 L/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma. Approximately 12% of bimatoprost remains unbound in human plasma.EliminationMetabolismBimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation following ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety of metabolites.ExcretionFollowing an intravenous dose of radiolabeled bimatoprost (3.12 mcg/kg) to six healthy subjects, the maximum blood concentration of unchanged drug was 12.2 ng/mL and decreased rapidly with an elimination half-life of approximately 45 minutes. The total blood clearance of bimatoprost was 1.5 L/hr/kg. Up to 67% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine while 25% of the dose was recovered in the feces.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionBimatoprost, a prostaglandin analog, is a synthetic structural analog of prostaglandin with ocular hypotensive activity.

The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss.12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorptionAfter one drop of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% was administered once daily to both eyes of 15 healthy subjects for two weeks, blood concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and were below the lower limit of detection (0.025 ng/mL) in most subjects within 1.5 hours after dosing. Mean Cmaxand AUC0 to 24hrvalues were similar on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/mL and 0.09 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively, indicating that steady state was reached during the first week of ocular dosing. There was no significant systemic drug accumulation over time.DistributionBimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues with a steady-state volume of distribution of 0.67 L/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma. Approximately 12% of bimatoprost remains unbound in human plasma.EliminationMetabolismBimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation following ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety of metabolites.ExcretionFollowing an intravenous dose of radiolabeled bimatoprost (3.12 mcg/kg) to six healthy subjects, the maximum blood concentration of unchanged drug was 12.2 ng/mL and decreased rapidly with an elimination half-life of approximately 45 minutes. The total blood clearance of bimatoprost was 1.5 L/hr/kg. Up to 67% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine while 25% of the dose was recovered in the feces.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionBimatoprost, a prostaglandin analog, is a synthetic structural analog of prostaglandin with ocular hypotensive activity. It selectively mimics the effects of naturally occurring substances, prostamides. Bimatoprost is believed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in humans by increasing outflow of aqueous humor through both the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral routes.
